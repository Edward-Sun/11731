now , why does this matter to human health ?
here &apos;s a diagram of the pc stress of dolphins in sarasota bay .
and i remember sitting at my desk , thinking , &quot; now i know what a great scientific discovery was , &quot; but it was so dreadful .
they &apos;re being closed all over the world and over and over and over the same reason , and i think that &apos;s what to let us do with more genout-of-the-art .
at first , i showed you how much we &apos;ve identified the ecosystem of monterey bay through pollution and the conservation industry and all of the problems that we &apos;ve heard about it . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
hhhh -- hhhhhh -- hhhhhhh .
around the same time , his mother had asked him , &quot; do you know the book of michael morpurgo ? the &quot; snowy ? &quot;
we were really afraid .
craig here is moving the head .
you still have the skeleton .
we also have this ability .
in fact , our modern way of approaching something has its benefits , but i think we should also recognize what price is .
clay shirky , this great christ of all networking , has a premise that &apos;s put here in the test that &apos;s been recognized in a wonderful way .
today , there are so many new foundations that accumulate pools and investments that bring people together , together for a goal , in a larger context .
and i &apos;m hopeful , because not only do the philanthropy reorganize , but other large parts of the social sector and in business life are diligently the business business business as usual .
i true this photograph close to me . it &apos;s in my office , because i &apos;ve always felt a mystical connection to these two men , i &apos;ve never learned both of them .
my own research on cell phones and internettelection shows that 80 percent of all calls actually go to four people . 80 percent .
whenever you have a moment , chaters chat .
and with the modern bureaucracy , a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private environment and the public environment .
we worry that sooner news , texting , facebook of interintimacy , but stefana broadbent research shows how the communication technologies can promote deep relationships to convey love about the barrier of the distance and the workplaces .
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed multiple vehicles -- is , as we believe , the first autonomous drift car in the world .
for example , the rowing brain tends to generate a lot of alpha-waves .
no challenging task .
right now , taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars a year sending a person to jail .
her family has been living in a city for eight generations called whitesville , west virginia .
yeah .
we can create these local markets and incentives to use recycled materials as commodities for manufacturing .
and we should all be investing in it .
and he sometimes won , you hardly believe in a railroad in los angeles -- one reason to love l.a. -- back in the 1940s .
i started my company to help communities all over the country , use their existing potential to improve the entire quality of life of their people .
and before you don &apos;t have children , you &apos;re not going to understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people will discover at some point in adulthood community .
it always takes time .
really blame only comes out of a offense against one person , and somebody with down syndrome is not a person . &quot;
to argue about people , it &apos;s not too far anymore .
but i found out , for me , that i found the kids i was born , that i love that i don &apos;t want to introduce a life without you .
he wouldn &apos;t really extend his legs .
i come from a privileged family . i &apos;ve been very lucky .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . and there they are .
this is in the beginning of 2000 . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here today , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia and built by us built school just as it was connected to the internet .
remember -- because there are other people like bill gates who said , &quot; man , you have a real computer . &quot;
latin is also pretty rare . let &apos;s look at some languages .
and guess what ? we won it .
we made a case for integrating no additional features to keep the price possible at the bottom .
for a vegetable plant , my apartment is about as alien as space .
and we can take care of the issues of newcomers .
speaking of a fiscal cliff , i was told to be too partisan , even though i don &apos;t know what partei supports or attacks .
prosperity is discharged to people that you shouldn &apos;t call unproductive .
in tax , there &apos;s bigger disagreements here .
none of these most important theories was a full success .
we &apos;re afraid the world is watching .
and as a lot of this work we found something , or i found something that really fascinated me , maybe you can remember it .
in fact , it &apos;s just happening here -- from light to dark to six seconds .
i look at their faces very carefully .
that &apos;s not an expression of pleasure .
this lady here actually has a particularly symmetrical face , and both sides of it are beautiful .
this thing here , it &apos;s flucking light over , as you move , so it gets a kinetic object , although it &apos;s silent -- just by how brilliant this is done by the reflection .
i had to move that part , but i just had a millimeter .
and the one i showed you before was , of course , a very complex one .
it wins or loses at that moment .
the emotional band between this object and you , is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it .
i don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
it &apos;s also a thought that we &apos;ve forgotten .
i think it &apos;s necessary for me to go back to the tradition of sermons .
again , we don &apos;t think that way .
and at the end of the talk , you &apos;re all standing up and saying , &quot; let &apos;s be platon , thank you shakespeare , thank you jane austen . &quot;
the other thing is that art shouldn &apos;t explain , that artists should not tell their motives , because if they devastated them , it destroyed the magic and we might start it too simple .
art would be one of the tools that we can improve our society by .
we may not agree with what religions want to teach us , but we can admire the institutional kind that they do with .
absolutely . i meet , like many of you , on people who say , &quot; isn &apos;t there something bigger than all of you , something else ? &quot;
because you agree 90 percent , because you have a similar way of looking at so many things , and you &apos;re probably going to be polite in other opinions .
so he led me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , in underground mines , in the japanese alps , in north america , to antarctica and even to the south pole .
it &apos;s the largest seas in the world . it &apos;s 800 kilometers long .
and they &apos;re not going to believe it , but this is going to be called the measurably large telescope .
this hut was built by robert falcon scott and his men when they came to antarctica , on their first expedition to the south pole .
think that all the wires make people in extreme cold , down below zero temperatures .
this is an interesting statement , i &apos;ll end up on it .
what people do first is book readers , where you can search within the book , and that &apos;s fun .
it was quite a lot of people .
but how do we all scan them ?
we &apos;ve reached 10 cents a page when we work with big volume .
i &apos;m not sure what lavish means .
it melts about two or three bands a day .
with 15 dollars an hour of video and about 100 to 150 dollars an hour of celluloid movie , we can make some material very cheaply online and have it on the net .
the question is , is this the world that we want to live in ?
flowers are going to be laughing .
we all know that the earth has problems .
by educating spores , they rot .
if you go through the landscape , it fails up into your footsteps , and it tries to react with the rubble .
across all the land .
some of these mushrooms are very happy .
this is an extraordinary rare fungus .
i did something that nobody else would have done .
the box of life -- you get a ted conference dvd -- you give earth and water , and you have both mycorrhizale and endophytic fungi , like spores , like agaricon mushrooms .
i also lived in biosphere 2 .
we wanted to know , is life adaptive enough ?
so i &apos;ve sort of eaten myself all the time .
and the physician looked at us to make sure that we were really good at it .
and all of them went to me .
eritrea , used to be part of ethiopia , is one of these places that are amazingly beautiful and incredibly carg , and i have no idea how people can do it .
this , this beautiful picture , this is the amazon .
this is actually an augo area .
i had to think about how to sew and cut , but also how to choose the right person that comes into an ope hall .
you took the break , you took the blood off , you injected the blood , you looked at it under the microscope , put the culture in , injected the antiserum .
but we need a boxencrew , boxencrews for patients .
and this is what medicine feels like sometimes .
we looked at skyscrapers , we looked at the airport companies , and we found that they have technology and education , and then they have one more thing : they have checklists .
and it &apos;s hard to spread .
so these are really tremendously many bees , and this is very significant .
so what that means is that beekeepers can replace their dead people very well , and in doing so , keep the losses straight .
you take your beehives and you convert your families to twice a year .
honeybees are in the minority .
if we take a cave in new york with a population of 15,000 bats , now it &apos;s 1,000 . that &apos;s as if san francisco was in three years the population of half the land circles .
now , not all of us have proven , or race that we can convert , and of course , you can always produce a meadow in a pot .
and i whistled on the saint night with my wife &apos;s family .
and to defend my title -- like judoka and other athletes -- i thought i did this again in 2005 , and i won again .
it &apos;s very promising .
why ?
the blue whale , the biggest living thing on our planet . it &apos;s completely wrong .
during the night , they rolled in their leaves and they decrease the movement , and during the day , the leaves are opening -- there &apos;s a lot more movement .
he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends , j.d. hooker , then the president of the royal society , the greatest scientific authority in the u.k. , where he spoke about a plant brain .
so far , the human had been inspired only by man or the animals when he made a robot .
she doesn &apos;t know that she &apos;s being filmed .
and then when it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh about .
i was inspired by that .
this is in 2005 .
they got two of my guys who had hiding cameras in tray bags .
it &apos;s a wonderful way to spend a weekend afternoon watching a football game in a stadium .
the idea is still in the beginnings , but it looks like this today .
this is ted .
and this is the bann i want to break .
well , children who are not tired yet are a special case .
they &apos;re a kind of ektosymbiont .
the discoveries of natural selection are genius , incredibly brilliant .
that &apos;s what we did on this planner .
the ant is not alone .
you &apos;ve just heard this guy .
i really appreciate that .
well , i don &apos;t think that .
now maybe we should take it metaphorically .
it &apos;s the devil that speaks . &quot;
so they &apos;re actually an acquisition , each of them is an individual chord .
men , if you don &apos;t understand anything from this talk , it &apos;s trying to listen to the expansively , and you can change your relationships .
the third problem with the headphones is the deafness -- noise &apos;s weightness .
cloning is a wonderful way of doing that .
i &apos;ll leave you with more avian twin , which is very good for you .
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but i can show you . &quot;
look at what &apos;s in the middle there .
they &apos;re looking at this way , so i &apos;m going to close it here .
we were sending this type of materials .
it &apos;s actually seven billion hanging pairs that follow all of your own passion , and it all comes together as part of a mosaic and create this world -- in your backyard and in your kitchens .
and yet , you can hear black holes , even though they &apos;re invisible , and the reason is that they &apos;re playing on space-time like on a drum .
our sun is not going to end as a black hole .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow of a black hole , but black holes can be heard even if they &apos;re invisible .
we can predict how this will sound .
there &apos;s also to be a mission for space that hopefully will be launched within the next 10 years . it &apos;s called lisa .
it &apos;s closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago we &apos;ve painted even more cave pictures .
trees are still embodied .
that &apos;s what i think is movement .
we are critical to the west , the view of the west , what our identity approaches -- the picture that we draw about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
but instead , i found a country that was completely ideological , and i didn &apos;t recognize that anymore .
that iran was once a world society , and we had a democracy , and that this democracy was stolen by the american government and by the british government .
i stand here to say that the iranian women have found a new voice , and their voice gives me my voice .
on this self , a big one , a wholeness , should concentrate .
there is no american compassion .
maybe the swami is right .
they learn swimming by swimming . they learn wheels by bicycle .
the fossils of this animal are only found in this area in south america -- a beautiful field here -- and in this part of africa .
they just look at these videos . when they get bored , they just keep going .
but i was thrilled , and so i went on .
the khan academy videos are also there .
this is the shifting and reflecting functions .
red means they &apos;re singing .
a lot of the efforts to make the classroom human is focused on &quot; students &quot; teacher ratio . &quot;
and the collaboration that you had with los altos , how did you get here ?
is it ready for the big worker ?
a few months ago , i got a call from a nursing home i work in .
but it &apos;s silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
for example , when his grandchildren visited him , he said , &quot; and who are these good-looking young men ? &quot;
and then , when you &apos;re standing there , the young one suddenly flew up , 30 meters up , and disappeared .
these characteristics of dialogue do not exist in these charles bonnet hallucinations .
there &apos;s an area in the anterior part of this gyrus , where the teeth and eyes are represented , and that part of the gyrus is activated when people have the imagined hallucinations .
&quot; kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
sometimes i find them interesting . and i have lots of pictures of it in my notebooks .
edith widder : i &apos;ve taken this footage with a special camera whose sensitivity corresponds to the darkness of the fittest eye .
for example , this craba crabs odd bioluminescent materials into the water , just like a squid or some squid generates a cloud of ink .
this looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
there &apos;s something small that responds to it .
it should attack the hunters of the calmar .
one approach would be to draw a picture .
if we dissolve the double helix in your two strands , you &apos;ll see that these things look like teeth .
it &apos;s packaged and wrapped .
one is wrapped into a cube .
again , these are all accurate , scientific deals .
keep your eyes open and your head moving .
the ability to do concepts intuitively with images of objects and processes .
if the subject &apos;s still very thin , it can be confronted with care and hard work to acquire experts around the world .
i &apos;m here to commit them to support us to change the way people and other creatures do things .
didn &apos;t come through the press , but it allows for collective action that emerges from literacy .
the other great narrative of social dilemmata is the tragedy of the commons .
toyota , instead of selecting its suppliers against each other , treats them like a network and training them to produce better , even though they also train them to produce better for their competitors .
thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , it &apos;s all about freezers and difficulty running and breathing -- cold , challenging conditions .
first of all , we did a little experiment where we gave people legos and they left them to build something .
and if they said yes , we gave them a new one , and as they built this up , we took the other one they just built , apart again .
there was a very beautiful relationship between love for lego and the number of built legos .
and i think that the ceo basically didn &apos;t understand how important meaning is .
but i should point out , by the way , that in the shredder situation , people could have cheated .
people didn &apos;t want them .
and we had two types of people .
now think of children .
and i think that in the industrial revolution adam smith was right when karl marx , but we really overdid scaffold . and now we are in the knowledge society .
this is completely normal in modern conflict , because children are very easy to send themselves to war .
but my mother &apos;s vietnamese was so bad that she , in order to make our history of credibility , had given all of our young and girls to vietnamese names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the population are illiterate .
they didn &apos;t want to do that . it just happened . they lost control .
and 70 percent won their lives back .
i think all of this has given me energy .
that &apos;s the european average for retrailer .
at the top right , bahrain has the same energy consumption per person in about canada , over 300 light bulbs per person , but the population density is 300 times larger , 1,000 people per square kilometer .
if you really want to extract a lot of solar cells , you &apos;d have to take the traditional bayeran agricultural methods where you don &apos;t just cover the roof , but also covers the landscape with solar cells .
and a third possibility is nuclear power .
i tried it out . it works . some call it the lifestyle change .
as a boy , ever since the early days , i wanted to be a musician , and thank god , i &apos;ve become it as well .
he &apos;s a boy from a community in caracas who did his contrabasshours in the junior chester of the sans agustin with passion .
that encourages you to come up with new dreams , new goals and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer .
this is a stolen technology that helps you to acquire the right pill at the right time .
we call simple , interruptive technologies , and that &apos;s the first of five sentences i &apos;m going to discuss in this talk .
that &apos;s what happened this year . she went to the early courtship .
the first word &quot; doc &quot; is the first word .
many of these generation will not press the button , even if you have an emergency system , because you don &apos;t want to fall to the load for others , even if you paid 30 dollars a month .
the color represents different spaces in the house .
i &apos;m going to show you some of the latest and fiesesten inventions of cybercriminals .
if you want your rival offline to go , you will .
how do you get a usb stick to creep into a company ?
so let &apos;s imagine our attacks that we call for fun hackers , making a little bit of a fieses in it . &amp; lt ; em &amp; lt ; em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
there are some other interesting contributions that cybercriminals have uploaded .
well , you &apos;re probably wondering what happened to these people .
at 761 of them , i was able to identify hotels in which they were recently , through the point of precise precision on the globe somewhere in the globe .
thank you .
the old animals can see the juveniles , the juveniles can see the adults .
and you &apos;re in something that &apos;s probably the blood vessels that are running through the bone .
we all know that these bones are fossilized , and if you dive them in acid , there should be nothing left .
the non-avian dinosaurs are the great , elusive , extinct .
also transgenesis is really cool .
a friend , a colleague , dr. hans larsson at mcgill university is also dealing with atavisms .
people always say , &quot; why are you doing this ?
and finally , i began to write my book to show the global scale of this problem , which shows a representation of individual nations after the valued levels of food waste in every country in the world .
so imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the trash represent the global food supply , okay ? in the beginning , we have nine .
this farmer , about 16,000 pounds , invested in building the spinat spinat , which he didn &apos;t harvest a leaf , because some grass potatoes that are not perfect , feeds on the pigs .
it &apos;s a living organism , i cut off a piece , put it into a vase , and it held another two weeks .
and if you use these things , you don &apos;t need to do sooo .
i &apos;m going to go through a few . bolotnitsa .
left to thymiamata .
we really have to change the stuff .
here &apos;s einstein , of course , niels bohr , the great fermatching sentence , and i &apos;m not sure if the james coburn or richard harris .
and you can see the icosahedron disappears in the dodecahedron , and they just fuse them together .
which is a good-looking cat .
before the horse .
&quot; 10 milligrams , 20 milligrams . &quot;
so , i said , if i pull a circle , let &apos;s see what the pattern is coming out of it , and boom , the red system .
you have to be right ! it &apos;s all about measurements , extensions .
and then there were only two other dannys on the internet .
i &apos;ll come to talk later .
i mean , to put everything on &quot; off , &quot; that would be like a call of your cable provider , but for the whole world .
it could definitely be done by people here from the audience .
if , for example , 350 years ago , we had a chance at tedxparis , we would have been talking about the current innovations of military , about massive regulations like vauban , and we could have predicted an era of stability in the world or in europe .
now , in this environment , where you don &apos;t know if the potential enemy is prepared for defense or attacking , and whether the weapons are gifted to attack , that environment is the most appropriate thing to do is to solve a conflict .
it &apos;s a huge blue surface .
so if you ever put yourself back in time to see what a dinosaur might have looked like , this is what a dinosaur looks like .
it can &apos;t always shoot your threads everywhere ; it &apos;s got to go down the pants .
he never seems to let himself stop at a certain girl .
but what i did was i was an adventure narrative .
you don &apos;t have to worry that the readers fall in unbeliefs , because when you imagine a redend shark , they let their doubt go back to the front door .
you will realize a kind of urgency , as much as you can in as possible as you can in as short as possible .
my depiction was wonderfully vage : inspection of wilderness and public labor . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
that means that i make my love about math and magic to make something that i call &quot; mathemagia . &quot;
audience : 25th .
audience : 987 .
audience : seven . seven .
all right . then i try the impossible -- or at least improbable .
audience : november . what ?
of course , i could think of an answer , and you wouldn &apos;t know it . i &apos;m prepared for it .
ok , oh , ok -- you also have a 10-digit calculator ?
so let me tell you what that is .
i &apos;d love to talk about astronomy , but i think the number of people who are interested in radiation transmits in non-dignity atmospheres and light polarization in the upper atmosphere of jupiter is the number of people who fit in a waiting pound .
no , if you want to know how society is going to be in 20 years , ask a kindergarten nerin .
just two weeks ago , i -- you know , i did little , middle and large bottles for the exhibition .
my mentor . he came up and spent an hour with me .
i &apos;ll take lunch tracks .
right ? that &apos;s simple physics .
if you look at it in the book , it &apos;s actually 343 .
and i think , ah , the square of the length is proportional to the period of time .
you would think , with all this extra space , we would have plenty of space for all our stuff .
it &apos;s time for me to separate myself from it .
would that be a little more freedom ?
north of churchill , manitoba , in october and november , there &apos;s no ice on the hudson bay .
it &apos;s cost many years of studying personal games stories before i really started to realize that i didn &apos;t really understand it completely .
frank wilson wrote a book called &quot; the hand . &quot;
so what is the brain doing now ?
it took a really long time -- i had to get homer down and get him through the fmri and the spect through and several times eegs , but as a graduate pocket , he &apos;s got a hull &apos;s brain .
their own personal play story is unique , and we often don &apos;t think about anything that we &apos;re particularly thinking about .
it &apos;s characterized by a sense of energetic focus , complete agreement and success in doing .
how do you prevent the media to interpret their work , or to interpret the science of what their work now indicates , like the mozartmetaphor , say , &quot; oh , the mris -- that play tends intelligence .
the difference between our nachos and the landmargin retrospect is that we &apos;re actually descended .
br : and then , after a short dive bath in liquid nitrogen , to get this perfect brate effect , we really have something that looks , tasty , and it acts like the original .
once again , the ipcc in paris , his report on human beings caused climate change .
alisa miller gives us news about the news .
it allows you to look at the negative forms that you create , as you go to your daily directions .
for this project , we &apos;ve developed a kind of intelligent simultanese subtitle .
no matter where i am -- there &apos;s a technology that &apos;s trying to locate my eyes .
inside , there &apos;s a 400 kilogram robotic arm that i &apos;ve borrowed from a friend .
at the time , there were thousands of people , we think that were infected with hiv .
: erzaehler : deep in a remote region of cameroon , two hunters are following their prey .
but you &apos;re likely to ask you a different question as well .
but when we came out in this laying doerfer , we found that no one had television there didn &apos;t know his face .
now , unnoble to say that these viruses in the past are likely to occur in these ancient societies that have probably gone extinct .
you tell what you &apos;re doing now , with the help of 140 signs or fewer people interested in this updates .
we constructed a programming interface , which means that programmers can write software that interacts with twitter .
&quot; ... you give people more information , and you follow your intuitions # ted . &quot;
because all i had read were books where people were executives , i was convinced that books , from nature , had to include foreign countries , and they had to act about things that i couldn &apos;t identify with .
all i heard about you was how poor you were , so that it was impossible for me to think of you as anything other than poor .
and slowly , i realized that my american roommate in her life had to hear different versions of this single story , just like this professor , who once told me that my novel was not &quot; authentic african . &quot;
so if you start the story of north american residents with the arrows and not with the residents of the british , you will tell a very different story .
i always felt that it was impossible to engage in a place or a person , if you &apos;re not engaged with all the stories of this place or this person .
i give a writing class every summer in lagos , and i find it amazing how many people are going to attribute to how many people necessarily want to write to tell stories .
in a recent experiment , in a group of adults , the brains have been scanned in an mri scanner -- while people have listened to people .
why has my doctor got me when i was operated , &quot; woman , bear in mind , don &apos;t get hyperpyrexy ? &quot; and he could also have told me that i don &apos;t have to pay attention to getting high fever .
my father is sick of alzheimer &apos;s disease .
and reading is as good as impossible .
even though it &apos;s difficult .
so we have to orient ourselves to the physical and economic boundaries .
in the sense , we also formulated our promises .
if you have difficulty understanding what that means for the average consumer in the united states right now in the economic environment .
if you want a fish , you get a woman and if you need a woman , you get a fish . &quot;
and if it &apos;s going to be a longer ride , you can still change the battery and move on the island .
this is the u.s. daycare consumption that we have today .
in india , you don &apos;t really understand where the problem is , because most indians are dancing every time two or three gallons .
all we need is 10 percent of the energy generated .
we don &apos;t sit it immediately . maybe we let the children free and keep slaves .
the arguments of the so-called id theorist are the same old arguments that have been reresisted over and over and over again since darwin &apos;s time to this day .
the darwinian natural selection is so amazingly elegant , because they &apos;re explaining the problem of explaining complexity in the form of nothing other than simplicity .
so the next one is , &quot; the president of the royal society has given a strong sense of persuasion , &quot; -- &quot; -- that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
it feels in a troubled minority , but how do the american atheists actually sit together ?
i haven &apos;t seen any numbers for top scientists in other fields like history or philosophy , but i would be amazed if they were different .
darwin thought that atheism was right and good for the icons is that the faithful people , but probably , quote , &quot; not ripe for that . &quot;
when people like -- when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein use the word &quot; god , &quot; they , of course , use it as a practical metaphor for this deep , mystical part of physics that we don &apos;t yet understand .
and the start cost about 500 dollars in roughly the value of 10,000 dollars today .
in the old days , in wireless , a person actually had the license , and they had to decide whether this was based on license or ownership .
just because there is a certain sense , or if several are involved , like wikipedia , ) a certain set of social relations .
i don &apos;t have any slides , so you &apos;re going to have to be able to do with me .
a study of economic competing for africa has shown that there &apos;s a clear warm up in 28 african countries .
the state shouldn &apos;t interfere with the creation of being and services , because it &apos;s inefficient and incompetent in this area .
but what it removed immediately was the kind of variations that had dominated our economic development -- so , when the oil price was up , our economy grew very fast .
we do the same thing in the insurance sector .
otherwise , i would have given myself that you &apos;ll see this .
he called it , &quot; massively fatal discontinuity , &quot; which means that it could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we didn &apos;t need to know how a vaccine worked precisely .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they are constantly changing .
these drugs are not cure , but they represent a huge triumph of science , because they have the automatic death rate of hiv diagnosis at least for those who have access to them .
but you know , the research that &apos;s happened to hiv has really helped us with the progress for other diseases .
this was a slow , time-full process that was dependent on chicken eggs , millions of life-chicken eggs .
and beyond the radical increased production , and the great cost savings of e. coli method , for example , that i just talked about -- look at the time i got to -- that would be saved lives .
so the challenge is full power .
the question is : why ?
do you think the african union is going to organize such a conference ?
there are some things you have to know .
the speaker who was here on the stage in front of me , idrim mohammad , pointed out that we had hundsmiserable leaders in africa .
by stealing it from your people &apos;s suffering .
traditionally africans hate governments -- they hate tyrannei .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get any help from the government , and he builds a second , bigger boat .
something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge for algorithmic filter , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re breathing this balance because they &apos;re basically going to go what you &apos;re doing first .
it &apos;s supposed to bring us to new ideas and to new people and alien perspectives .
and the man said , &quot; quite beautiful decrease , what ? &quot;
i know you &apos;re waiting for another bad environmental news -- i &apos;m just fun -- but now it &apos;s just a quick repetition , and then i &apos;ll show you new materials about possible solutions .
until the fillmstart in may , there will be a update on version 2.0 where you can then go directly to the purchasing of balances .
again , all republicans here : it shouldn &apos;t be about partisan policy .
what really impressed me about the gulf is that they are explicitly aquatic humans .
and there , actually , no one is trying to use any more , except a few people trying to keep using the beach .
we raised that bacteria eat oil ?
these tunas go through the entire ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor bombed , at least they shot at least at least at the moment .
in terms of the leuvers of the birds , i don &apos;t want to do digit remarks about people cleaning the birds .
okay , people who refer to themselves as a conservative , if they really wanted to be conservative and right patriotic , then they should send these corporations to the high .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i developed a system to produce medical isotope .
all right , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes &quot; -- all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to do it because it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
they have a molecule that we know as a neurotransmitter .
and this is just a mouse brain . it &apos;s much smaller than a human girl .
well , neurons , like trees , can grow and lose new branches .
and we can even talk about the stream of consciousness .
if you blame that number , then you can easily see that there &apos;s a huge potential for misconnections in the brain .
perhaps this technology will be able to meet ourselves by engaging and putting our own brain together .
he &apos;s mostly working on music videos and ads with his company , the directors bureau .
so we &apos;ve been preparing a quick experiment to show you this .
ks : no , not yet .
while he was doing that , he noticed an unexpected thing .
ks : so how does this work : there &apos;s a matrix of dyer .
ridiculous , right ?
and a couple of months ago , a friend sent me a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a couple of weeks .
but he was still doing that .
so his court is incredible .
and then he found this wild plant , the lupine .
and then they fly in a circle .
i finally got to try them before i left .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what the hell does that mean ?
at least i believe . anyway , i believe it .
farmers who rely on nature to find solutions to enforce answers rather than to overcome nature &apos;s solutions .
and turning from the old to the new fire , is changing two big stories about oil and electricity that both give two fifths of the fossil carbon to the air .
our fuel for mobility goes to three fifths of cars .
you can just drop it down : it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
also better light and office materials and so forth , the maximal refrigeration is about a third .
already in about 20 states , private installing solar panels put cheap solar cells with no financial losses on their roofs and lower their side costs .
and whatever we replace it , it &apos;s going to cost about six trillion dollars in capital value -- at the same time we buy more of what we have or new nuclear power and so-called clean , coal , renewable ones that are more or less centralized .
so , focusing on outcomes , not motivations , reformstau and conflict can lead to the resolution of energy problems in america .
it wasn &apos;t until later that i noticed that what i had eaten was the two days of his whole family .
this simple shift shows that donors in places where the least children go to school have not funded schools , and this raises new questions . accomplished aid that they need the most ?
two years ago , april 8 , 2010 , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember that , and can this suggest in every book of my 10-year-old son , that life emerged four billion years ago -- four billion comma two ?
so similarly , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are dangers , there are fall . there &apos;s a trap : the plumb .
you have time to think , you have time more than something to do , to talk about art and things like that .
you go back to the future , back , back , like this .
they all come from families that are often only one person at home , usually the mother or grandmother , and they come to their education and their structure here .
we teach them to turn to the right and on the left so that they can recommend and know the consequences when they miserate commands .
let them all go online . &quot;
it &apos;s predictable .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for government work .
then you can support us . that &apos;s the job of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
you can listen and talk .
take , for example , the vendor of nextpedition .
when you think about the concept of wikipedia where everybody works at the content , and in the end , you &apos;ve created the largest encyclopedia in the world .
there are a lot of people who have the same dream .
a website was created .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what &apos;s happening there is an incredibly complex process .
we can keep the sounds of our own language apart , but not the strangers .
we reviewed that by listening to american babies who had never heard a second language , at the beginning of the critical period of mandarin .
it looks like a hair dryer from mars .
science on the one hand has a very rational approach to your surroundings , while art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its environment .
now i have a live demonstration over here to show you this .
let me demonstrate this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are necessary .
the fatty tiles were rejected by a little girl whose body was massively burned .
it &apos;s part of every human empire .
and if compassion is so good for us , then why don &apos;t we choose with compassion ?
the wound sits in front of maggots .
imagine you like square numbers , and honestly , who doesn &apos;t like it ?
we start with a 1x1 square , and then we put another 1x1 square next to it .
then there was aron kader , a palestinian american .
i said , &quot; he &apos;s already dead .
&quot; did i get a chuck ! &quot; i didn &apos;t get a memo . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
so i went to the lobby and saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : when you asked him for deception , he said , ansager : magic is the only honorable profession .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate to you how eng terrorism is associated with our daily lives .
by the time i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their lives were not governed by ideology and politics , but by economic pressures .
i think a lot of people actually thought i was shooting for a little bit .
but most of all , they went into serious business relationships with organized crime .
this money has been exposed into coffers and containers -- in a bar , it &apos;s understanding .
nobody wants the u.s. financial oversight to control his relations and overwhelmed his business with customers .
now some of you may think , &quot; wait a minute . you don &apos;t necessarily look like a high-end rowder .
sure , i wanted to leave my sense of comfort , but what i sort of didn &apos;t perceive was that by definition , it &apos;s extremely reluctant to leave its sense of comfort .
and i really learned that the bigger the challenge , the greater the feeling of a special performance when you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really big .
but that didn &apos;t go without a mischief .
it &apos;s this little green slice on the horizon , which makes them very nervous because of the rising sea level .
we can start making better , smarter , more sustainable decisions .
roz savage : why i row across the pacific
this is the world trade center building site on the front page .
why ? why ? why would you like to do that ?
it doesn &apos;t see excess costs . it doesn &apos;t consume extra time .
they were able to make this .
and in the end , it &apos;s comfort , it &apos;s about feeling good in places you wouldn &apos;t have felt well before .
and that &apos;s hard if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i wondered , how could it be so easy to give up my dreams ?
it &apos;s not that hard to put a man in front of school , and one day before school i said , &quot; yeah , you can write my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers i had written up at night before .
we were both replaced on the back benches in the class , so we wouldn &apos;t be bombarded with paper kitchens .
maybe you brought your prellings and collapsed teeth , but never told you , because how can you claim yourself if everyone wants to dig you down around you ?
this is french science .
all right , here we go .
if you look at this truck here , it &apos;s the largest truck of its kind on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the biggest and the fastest growing frames of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also why canada is now number three in terms of carbon production per capita .
and as a father , i just can &apos;t imagine what a soul does .
by doing that , we remove a large part of our biggest carbon sink and replace it with the most greenhouse gasses of oil in the future .
the main object of their work is the bindi that you can buy in every store and put the millions of indian women on your forehead every day , and it &apos;s a ritual tightly attached to the institution of marriage .
raqib shaw was born in colkata , pulled up in kashmir and educated in london .
i hope to convince you that complex and complicated aren &apos;t always the same thing .
the coldest knot point is the one we want to influence -- the public support for the government .
so i proposed , in my first tedtalk , that we should be spending 21 billion hours a week playing video games .
only 30 minutes of online games a day went for an important improvement in the mood and the longer-term increase in pleasure .
why a game ?
how could such a trivial game have such a huge effect in such serious , sometimes endangered situations ?
there are four types of strength , or resilience , that contribute to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically confirmed things that you can do every day to build this resilience , you don &apos;t need trauma .
it &apos;s empowered by more practice .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake somebody hand for six seconds , the oxytocin level is going to increase strongly in your blood , the familiar hormone .
and in this project , there have actually been hundreds of people around the world right now , and do this with us , and actually thousands of people are involved in this project , in many of their different aspects .
and then some people from chicago and said , &quot; end 2007 is the slogan of the chicago humanities festival the global warming . we have a 280 square meter of gallery , and we want them to fill them in their reef . &quot;
clouds and nights are not just two concepts that fit well .
euclid said , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
it &apos;s infinite . it captures . it &apos;s exactly .
so we have , from wool , scarely domestic action , the proof that the most famous postulat of mathematics is wrong .
and their individual ideas , and their employment with this mathematical method .
this particular recursive property -- the self-esteem , i think , is the holy grail of neuroscience , the neurology . and eventually we &apos;re going to hope to understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise clear and intelligent , but when he sees his mother , he reaches his delusion , and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area is damaged , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
tables and chairs and fluses -- nothing happens , just like normal people , but if i show him a picture of his mother , the electrodermal activity is low .
he knows that his arm isn &apos;t there . nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling , sensory experience for him .
you might be able to solve the phantom pain , the convulsion in the phantom &apos;s body limb .
and my pain has disappeared . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have a phantom , so i didn &apos;t have phantom pain anymore in the elbow , i didn &apos;t spin , there &apos;s no phantom pain in the lower arm . all my pain has disappeared .
cis is blue , fis green , another tone might be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is buba ?
their sexual behavior is too human , where most of us don &apos;t cope with each other .
this is kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video are trained .
well done .
he &apos;s learned that if he can actually name both hands , with his quoted competing hives , he can make much larger and smarter spare .
a framework means a hut in the forest .
do he see where the sound comes from ?
because we think it &apos;s not biology , it &apos;s culture .
and some stars die in spectacular supernova explosions that let such remains .
on the right there is gravity . einstein explained that .
and more than that , it brings up new kinds of change .
it was too early on , but he was a moral guide , an inspiration for scientists who were concerned about the control of the weapons .
suppose aliens living creatures had observed our bubbles blue dot from far outside the cosmos and not only for 40 years , but the entire 4.5 billion years of natural history .
martin rees : is this our last century ?
and it gets worse , &quot; then i would take a picture of it , and i would make a dozen high-glue trains .
well , these are students , so they gave a lot of money for things like earrings and makeup .
and then we asked them how happy they are .
but enormously different motivations .
these are sold teams in belgium .
the teams that we gave to spend money on each other turned into other teams and dominated at the end of the lega .
when we hear about the dangers of war today , from high school , we often believe that this is another one of these dissolved conflicts of the middle east , whose roots are as old as the region itself .
ironically , this was at a time when the main interest of iran was to gold peace with washington , not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that is intentionally dispersing diplomacy , is the diplomacy decreased , is war inevitable .
you can search with certain usage , or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the port-au-prince map at the end of 2009 was not as good as it could have been , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is this .
to the explanation she said , &quot; he was not an environmentalist . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , also the status quo of an invasive government .
so it &apos;s not that my issue is the most important thing . that &apos;s not it .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , have to regain republic .
for example , some people in this room thanks to sputnik will have gone to school with a scholarship .
anyway , this is on my pencil . &quot;
it &apos;s just a little bit irre .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy is not true , it &apos;s true .
here in the model , you see the attack of the predator .
if you see fireflies in north america , they &apos;re acting as many things in the united states regardless of them . they ignore each other .
each of their heartbeat depends on this critical region , the sinush node , which has about 10,000 independent cells , each of which has an electronic rhythm -- a high tension , a low signal -- to pump a signal to the ventricles .
they were synchronized for a while , but then they were disconnected .
so i &apos;d like to first show you a couple of interviews with people who were at opening up on the bridge and describe what was going on .
now you don &apos;t normally think of yourself as a metronom , but we all run -- we &apos;re osciling back and walking back .
am : this weighs just a few tons , so it &apos;s going to go pretty fast .
it &apos;s the top motivated scientist in its domain .
i didn &apos;t tell you what the list was , but it was in alphabetic order , and i told them they should look for their names , their family names , or their girls names .
and also , perhaps this fowler apple , or maybe a prospect that is economic right now , is a resilience on illness or pests or a different property that is useful for climate change , and the others don &apos;t have .
we &apos;re going to see children starving on television .
so the idea of svalbard was that it &apos;s cold there , so you have natural temperatures under the freezing point .
and if something happens , then you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
pay attention to your body position ! this is not right here .
maybe some lady , a queen ? -- thank you .
you &apos;ve tried only two concepts -- two in the u.s. , and one in the russians .
insane ! i have to talk about innovation cycles -- things evolve , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they get replaced by something else , and they die .
i can &apos;t tell you when to go , because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my schedule .
i mean something really interesting that &apos;s going to happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development of manned space travel .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he &apos;s got a epiphany .
institutions become naked , and if you &apos;re naked , well , the consequences are .
the fourth meaning of openness and fourth principle is power winning .
the toothpaste is from the tube .
they know that bees and fish live in swarms .
all around us , a medical revolution is happening , a revolution that will help us defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , including cancer .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , an incurable mass , growing in a brain .
and you can see the ring disappears after treatment disappears .
but the real question is , how well do they work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add an earthquake extract , it prevents angiogenesis in very effective ways .
but even more interesting comes from the study that the men who have developed prostate cancer , the ones that have taken more tomato sauce , in the end , had less blood vessels that feed their cancer .
albert from scent-györi once said that &quot; discoveries consists of what everybody has seen , and think what nobody has thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a puzzle columnist at discover magazine .
it &apos;s got to be fun , unlike a single problem that &apos;s frankly not very well-designed puzzles .
one is the background of the other .
you might not be able to do that physically , but you can do it on a computer . over to the pc .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what &apos;s the heading that &apos;s going to fall here ?
so there are games like &quot; brain age &quot; for the nintendo ds , a huge hit .
looks like a black character . where is that ?
i really believe that being a girl , that is so powerful that we all had to train , not to be like that .
i remember , for example , my father , who was very , very violent , slammed me .
we &apos;re so used to counting girls of the demanding , protagonists of your own life , that we &apos;ve actually made them objects and turned them into being .
and she looked in the eyes of her baby , and she said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual where they were a girl running away with her families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your side for the rest of your life . &quot;
i love it that i don &apos;t make things easy .
why should you want to spin me , sit down ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers said , and they created the identities that they had made by the photo array .
but the incident happened in the middle of january , on the northern hemisphere , at 7 o &apos;clock in the evening .
this is 10 meters away .
and what &apos;s going to show this example -- what &apos;s important to keep ourselves in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a fulbright scholarship , and i traveled through africa a year where i asked people why they built fractals , which is a great job if you can get it .
and that continues in some villages to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would only use long straws because it goes very fast and it &apos;s very cheap .
just and not quite right now .
we have a mushroom program in ghana .
but the bad news is .
instead of applying to friends or related , they viewed davids &apos;s workplace .
today , agile development is applied to a hundred countries , and it &apos;s going to go all the way up to these kinds of distances .
the fear of bike losing . praying .
we set up some rules and we hold onto them .
the conversation will be better . &quot;
just as i got out tonight to come here , one of my daughters started screaming around .
and we developed 10 statements .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna karenina , &quot; and i read the famous first sentence : &quot; all happy families same to each other .
i want to show you how something invisible can be so beautiful to look at .
if i dive this into the water , you &apos;ll see a silver covering , and that complaint is the air layer that keeps the water from the poddles bench . it remains dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : uuuuuh ...
i &apos;m going to show it to you .
but tesla &apos;s success was not permanent .
one thing i &apos;d like to clarify is that not all neurosurgeons carry cowboyboots .
we can turn them up or down , turn on or off .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can use it in the circuits of mood in places of depression .
we &apos;re trying to figure out what these circuits are , and what areas of the brain are responsible for the clinical indication and symptoms of those diseases .
evolution actually works more like an engineer than an engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we &apos;ve discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human being , like richard , or a dish or a crab or a kangaroo , the relative confidence of that feather is the same for all of us that we &apos;ve seen until now .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s amazing , students tried to do it , and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he does that with a pressure-sensitive glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a role model , and we put them together with another fellow in berkeley .
showed that of the married married leaders , two-thirds of the married men have children , but only one third of the married women .
on monday , i left san francisco , my home place , and i flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , and we look at this and say , &quot; what &apos;s it going on for you ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study at harvard business school about a woman named heidi roizen .
and i &apos;ve taken my hand back down , and i noticed that in all other women , and then you &apos;ve taken more questions , just by men . &quot;
a woman contacted me in this , and i looked at her -- she looked a little young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as regular as they should , but they do it .
so , not fear was the defining factor .
but it &apos;s in the middle of the black .
i want to talk now about this , and think about how do we disseminate health information in this country , how do we get to information ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;re performed into more understandable language , and that &apos;s what works .
we tell them that everything is fine ; they &apos;re fine .
so this patient is about 50 , so we can pretty much say how big his risk is to get sick of prostate cancer .
they don &apos;t need the educational level of listeners in this room .
and this bumblebee had surely taken , &quot; i just snatched this apple tree , this bloom , i got the nectar , and then i got off . &quot;
and when you talk about nature , which is my favorite subject as an author , how is the idea of the aldo-leopold test ?
all right , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
the only technology here is the cheap electrofence : pretty new , attached to a car battery , even if i could barrier a headquarter of 10 minutes in 15 minutes .
when a purchaser grass , the grass is cut down to that altitude , and something interesting happens immediately .
and now i say that i want to build a layer of games on the top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s already happening .
if you don &apos;t , there &apos;s a shame . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
if you come to a certain amount of time , you get your drinks for half a prize .
and then you can do really well in different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
digg is a community dynamic that tries to find the best news , the most exciting stories .
we talked to you the last time a few years ago .
you can also see , if i turn this around -- hopefully i don &apos;t shake the world too much .
and you can see , this is where it started .
this is one of our engineers .
mendel , who was supposed to teach high school students , discovered the legislation of the heritage , just like this , a hobby .
raise your hands .
that &apos;s what makes it a place where it &apos;s fun to work .
and so this is something that we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who are excited about it and crazy enough that they &apos;re working on it , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what brunel , as he said , wanted to reach for his passengers , was the experience of slipping through the landscape .
what makes life easier , enjoyable ?
in part , they did this by building a great new facility , instead of using the basement of one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of the time have used to use brunels , and have actually become part of the present problem .
and like brunel , we can conceal ourselves to systems , have a bigger effect .
and i was very surprised by my persistence of the waiter with his boss .
mark lipper and i have tried to answer that question in a series of studies .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm demands .
but for the eastern european aggregation , the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the market was like a sintloose .
the americans themselves discover that unlimited choice in theory seem more attractive than in practice .
french parents would rather say things like , &quot; noah was just for such a short time here , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that &apos;s lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant nuance of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one thing in common : they &apos;re human problems controlled by natural forces .
so ... thank you .
it &apos;s supposed to replace competition with collaboration .
and then we build a six-meter version that we can test the maximum power of the machines , and so we can get very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the technology world is best understood not as a business cycle , but as a healing movement .
the atomic bomb enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear power plants that would enable the energy to fill the rest of los angeles .
and then you take it , and it pays it on the screen of your television , and it rides from within to outside , like this .
if you replace the word blogosphere or the internet today , it &apos;s very right now that it &apos;s very strongly suggesting that it &apos;s very generating now . let &apos;s hear it in a single way .
i think it was this exchange that led to pcs .
ph : i hope you &apos;ll figure out how subversive this is .
ultimately , the race has won the future of momentum , when the telecoms interrupt .
mm : because it has given the audience a role to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television has captured , which is built , is a very exciting new kind of communication , and we have the joints of two industries and a new way of thinking , to see it .
this is a spanish architect and designer .
color can limit simple blocks , simple materials : when i go through new york , i &apos;m holding it .
it has given me regulations -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk down and we set up some installations .
the place that the city laid on the public space for the day is significantly , almost an international model .
even the parts of the aircraft had french drawings .
he said , &quot; well , first of all , there are more girls there . &quot;
and it was , after some of the ups and the deep , the design of the chair that i was going to show you in a moment .
he said she &apos;s got one of the new , better chairs .
or they pull them up into the desired position .
but i knew from experience , and when i looked around the office , where there was firing chairs with headlines , that no one would ever come back to the idea , to go back to a bang and adapt the head chairs to get them in position .
and dengue fever has spread in windeseile .
two days ago or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember carefully , i read in a reuter-report that madeira signed the first dengue diseases , about 52 registered cases , with about 400 likely cases .
we need something that was really crucial to the place so that it doesn &apos;t spreading the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : male hits a lot , a lot of progresses .
so overhead is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time , i hardly get away from it , even though i &apos;m a far more world-bogglers .
look at the data available .
now , our mobile phones can now construct a story of our residential places .
bill davenhall : your health depends on where you live .
that &apos;s my grandfather .
for the simple reason nobody else talks about it .
as initial explains , plants are pulling phosphorus through water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a 2009-copy of &quot; nature , &quot; the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of it is going to be lost .
and instead of having a 100 percent dose , we &apos;re going to take one out of 25 percent .
we have a working technology and one that &apos;s going to be putting some of the printers on the world &apos;s phosphorus reserves .
and he was a so-called teratologist : he looked at all the absence and mutations to find the rules and the laws , rather than looking at the norms .
and in this example , you can see that the individual stages repeat , but they can &apos;t be repeated without being modular .
as an architect , i only think of the relationship between the parts and the whole , but in terms of product design , it becomes more and more an opportunity for business .
we were approaching the level of typology of the building , where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all merge on the 60th floor to a single monolithic mass .
come back , a few years later , 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape , frankly , looks like seswig holstein as it looks for rainforests .
the difference is particularly in irrigation facilities in the desert , or maybe golf places in scottsdale , whatever you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste there , a lot of things that have been done illegal and are now in the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by fertilizers that are causing huge problems for water quality , rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important factor of species extinction .
but we can , and there are opportunities to get it .
irrigation is the largest water consumers on the panels .
need to work together .
so -- what &apos;s actually the system system d ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system system d doesn &apos;t pay taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological verticulators to amplify these neural signals -- muscles .
this is what this looks like .
here we deincked , or sliced the nerve free , from little parts of the muscle , and let others untouched that gave us our high-down -- signal -- two others who give us our hand up -- gave us a signal .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t put electrode in and say , &quot; there we go . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal to have something clinically applicable to carry .
this is jesse and he presents an acting toy .
so thank you .
sub-saharan africa filled this condition largely , because there are 22 million people living with hiv , so that &apos;s 70 percent of the 30 million people that are infected globally .
governments in the field need to do effective review systems for ethical aspects in clinical trials that are approved in the different developing world : ethics represented by the government and the funders in the different countries in the study .
so the fundamental problems we face are too high consumption and too many people .
so they fulfill all the criteria that usually fails to people .
so you see this current going up to the north -- the humboldt stream in this case -- which goes to the galapagos islands , and this deep water stream , the cromwell stream , which is up at the galapagos .
we also know that not only galapagos penguins are threatened , but also magellanic penguins and other types of penguins .
now i want to show you penguins are drawn into compassion .
turbo used to knocking his pace on the door with a rapid barrel . we let him in , and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes out perfectly comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we haven &apos;t solved : our fundamental political geography .
they share a fairly long border .
again , as in the case of mongolia , china does not conquer russia . it &apos;s least it .
for poorer countries , china reduces its hesitation so that laos and cambodia can sell their commodities and be dependent on exports to china .
what i want to introduce you here is what i call state education , day after day .
these two arrows form a bow , an arc of pendolphins and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with gaza .
most of them .
so what &apos;s next ? what &apos;s the future of the european union ?
53 countries and by far most of the suspected straight lines on the map .
this dream exists its time .
is he bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone igf-1 promotes growth .
so how can a hormone eventually lower the speed of aging ?
we think insulin and igf-1 hormones are a hormones that are active in particular circumstances -- in good times -- if food is present to the environment , not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details of how it works , but we know that foxo genes have an impact on people &apos;s lifespan .
in principle , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process that i &apos;ve been talking about , which is going very fast in the worm , has another normal value , like , a bird , so that the bird can live a lot longer .
you will never see an ad like this , because nike wants you to buy your shoes .
you all have heroes that have been considered .
it &apos;s like trying to walk against a brick wall .
this view is made by many prescriptions like prozac basically changing the chemistry of the brain as if , in fact , the health of the tank of a chemical soup would actually be the brain of the container of a chemical soup .
and my name colleague , seymour benzer believes that too .
by the screening , we found that a mutant needed a much longer time to come down after the air puffs , and when we were reviewing the genes that were playing a role in this mutation , we could detect a dopamine receptor .
this question has been asked for a long time in people , but in fly , we can actually test it .
so , mosquitoes find us in the dark by sniffing us . they smell us .
just so you can see it , this is the cheese .
in fact , people told me they like to be stolen by mosquitos now .
in the u.k. &#91; unclear &#93; .
and every time i felt the wishly glimpses of the eyes of convicted prisoners behind me .
and it turns out that fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .
so as we speak , there are about 117 clinical studies of studying the use of stem cells for liver disease .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not just in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens if that &apos;s not what happens ?
but here &apos;s what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you anything about that , because i &apos;ve stopped doing the headline .
jenna mccarthy : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make these receivers , using the material that &apos;s coded in dna .
the animal jumps , it spreads its wings , it vibrates this , but it can &apos;t really cut off because the fly is trapped between two glass .
for an intelligent creature like our fly , this rule is not carved in stone , but it &apos;s changing as the animal learns through experience .
through many of these experiments , we were able to limit the identity of the critic to 12 cells .
there are some ideas in computer science and artificial intelligence , how you might do that , but we still haven &apos;t solved a single example of how smart behavior overwhelmed from the physical matter to living matter .
here &apos;s libby , or it &apos;s actually an ultrasound picture of libby .
ed : all right . tb : okay . a little indoors please , a little bit more to the center .
from my own experience , i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my graduate team from legacy .
one of the things i &apos;m going to tell you is this kind of foster customization that contains everything from your goals to your genes is going to be the most seminal shift that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime of health care .
they don &apos;t hap any like a velcro , any of them , or through acidity or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc raibert built the hüpfroboter uniroo .
what would happen if you climbed to the bottom of the leaf and you &apos;d get a bad one or we &apos;d shake the leaf ? &quot;
and that &apos;s the way they did it . and he &apos;s doing this .
of course completely different than you would see this in a natural film .
we &apos;re going to look at rising sea level .
and i would say that people who work in the oceans and think about what goals are , we think they should be much lower .
this is the ship i &apos;ve been with for the last three months in antarctica .
if this ice melts , sea level goes up by six meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , that &apos;s bad news for the corals of the galapagos islands .
their ratio gives water temperature .
but then at the very end , you see the thermometer records in black .
we have very interesting opportunities for the co2 level in the atmosphere for millions of years , we &apos;ve always done this with ice drill , but in this case , we &apos;re going to go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein set up : figuring out how gravity works .
already einstein had space and time , degraded and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of space , so the idea , there might be more dimensions than we see there .
and just like the strings of a cello vibrating , the strings that you see can vibrate in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction that might be able to explain some unimaginable properties of the world , or can we actually demonstrate these extra dimensions ?
so we &apos;ve got two plates on the bottom .
now , can italy someone see the predator , which is in attacking them ?
and what &apos;s true of sensory information is generally true of all information .
and we &apos;re looking at about 30 seconds on what a little bit of a hammer is in an 18 minutes long talk .
why ? because if the tiles were actually in this shadow , and the same amount of light would reflect on their eye like the caps outside the shadow , it would have to reflect -- simply reflect on laws of physics .
how do you know that ?
and it comes in the beehive , and it finds an empty honeytopf , and it &apos;s honey .
he finds it . insane , right ?
do you agree ? yes ?
a lot of times , there &apos;s no right or wrong here .
in new york , in 2010 , not so much .
we &apos;re also one species of storytellers .
now some things : understanding of safety , the risks , the risks , the counter-measures of how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks we face .
think of cancer , bird flu , swine flu , sars .
there was no new insights , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it confirmation errors by accepting data that shows our faith rejects and data that correspond to our faith rejects .
i trusted another group to see if my airplane was safe to fly with it .
this scared people .
and he was found here at stanford , at stanford .
they had good relationship with their teachers , students .
so let me ask you some questions to see if this is a good choice . &quot;
i assumed someone was going to sit there , or save them , where i could raise as a volunteer , but i found out that no one was doing something .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert hammond : building a park in the sky
and groups were called very often &quot; terrorists . &quot;
they need a final process to deal with which the core of this very complicated society can deal with its problems .
it &apos;s about probably the first time in the history of the arab world , we &apos;re seeing a revolution from the ground : a volksrevolution .
paradox of this is that the previous decade was so promising , and that &apos;s one key reason .
all of a sudden , the ngos called their slogans no longer just on the streets -- they put them in the negotiations , in part , because they dropped the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think monsteret is a good thing .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little bit crazy working on a new nuclear reactor .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and on the last day , the sun comes out , the orcas come out , they come straight to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to admit that i &apos;m a little nervous here , because i &apos;m going to tell you some radical things about how to think differently about cancer to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
there &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics , just comparing the genetic similarity .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; okay . at least this guy is well connected . &quot;
so we &apos;re basically measuring every one of our isotypes as our own .
if you have malaria , we &apos;ll give you china , or some derivatives of it .
where we really have to go , is the process that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s at the level of proteomical activities at the level of why the body doesn &apos;t heal itself , as it usually does ?
danny hillis : understanding cancer through proteomics
all of you are members in tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to just give these people up .
because at stage three , most of us are facing each other .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before anybody tried this .
in fact , martin luther king &apos;s famous sentence was stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair and i &apos;m not doing anything . &quot;
and all of a sudden they took out the paper sheets and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
we automatically cut the little bits of plastic up .
these one-story constructs that were designed to acquire just so much to enable the taxes for the ground that they &apos;re standing on were not thought of as permanent buildings .
they &apos;re looking at stability and security that can offer the lap of an uncle , comparing them with the shaky constructions of a neurotic niece in high heels .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most degrading form of sofortiger satisfaction .
i can &apos;t really explain them , and i can &apos;t explain them .
stories like these , signs like this are practical helpts in a world that yearns to bring compassion , the over-frequent images of suffering that could overwhelmingly overwhelmingly overwhelmingly overwhelmingly overwhelmingly overwhelming us .
gandhi was also a really miserable person .
and the first day , our group director took us and taught us our motto , which we now had to carry forward every day for the rest of the summer to make sense of the common sense .
this is one of two or three of their known ones .
so here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without instinctively imitating the other &apos;s opinion .
so this is the world we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from the example of my grandfather &apos;s in my own way .
okay , number two : go to the wild .
and imagine this , take an inner image : i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very poorly proportions , and my parents had no higher education .
and so we believe that through all the changes that have happened , that we now have incredible opportunities .
it &apos;s an initiative that &apos;s pointed to simple , accessible , and human-centered solutions .
we &apos;ve now saved 30 different technologists in 18 different countries , and we &apos;ve been able to connect millions of people , in the effort to continue learning what this particular segment needs and demands .
and my wedding day , my father came up to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember each generation has to do it better than the previous one .
i know a lot of people who are very smart , and yet , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started them in 1980 with another family .
don &apos;t you think we have the responsibility here to take protecting the environment seriously ? &quot;
i &apos;m still driving the same four years old ford as i did before .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he pray .
believe it or not , doesn &apos;t make any difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball represents your identity , what you are .
when my kids were little , i was walking into their room , sat down on their bed , looking at my children at sleep .
it &apos;s less than i calculated -- i calculated with three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , each with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character shooting for rocks .
they answer the question : what does it feel like to discover that you &apos;re wrong ?
we really learn this really bad lesson .
think of what it &apos;s like to feel right now .
and unlike any other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i &apos;m going to write this incredibly nerdy book about a topic , that all hate , for an audience that would never be there .
and the effect of that , of course , is not just golden wheat , but mountains of corn .
in 1986 , it came from vietnam to america .
and the answer to that was lapidar : &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our personal fluctuation was down to a third of the average in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom crashs , our operating size has tripled .
and bhutan , for those of you who don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy in the world , two years old .
in fact , it &apos;s so that in the west , we often hunt at happiness as if the happiness should be something we have to capture , a thing , or perhaps several things that we have to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders is that we can change the qualtity of production by creating the right conditions so that our employees can live their calling .
bl : all right . one , two , three .
under deck , you tell the inner ear , you move , but the eyes are moving in resemble with the boat , and they say , &quot; i stand still . &quot;
amy , you come up please ?
the method : what did you do ? the result : what have you noticed ?
i &apos;m just reading one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and enable them to express them as well , so amy should have the last word in this short story .
poor people don &apos;t have that possibility of choice .
we were thrown back to the &apos; 70s .
and to get there , we have to recognize that the principle of a throwaway culture is not only harming the kinds that we &apos;ve talked about , but also deserves our society .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure some of you have already wondered , &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at the u.s. davis system , and i got a lot of attention , and it allowed me to fund the launch of the program at the time .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart , and they end up here .
i mean , people are wondering whether mobile phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. soljacic : the chiming cell phone of his wife .
and for those of you who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural adjustments where not being put in are a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the existence in our bodies .
first , a burial suit , enriched with mushroom spores , the mushroom death suit .
it was only months later that i learned who he really was .
i &apos;m looking for a cure approach .
i say , &quot; hold it alive if you can . &quot;
even with this explicit paper in our hands , we &apos;ve redefined hope over and over again .
it &apos;s a feature .
he suddenly knows that he &apos;s been defeated .
so to give you this , we need to put them back in the driver &apos;s seat .
we flew that area , we photographed it , we sent people in , we photographed the buildings from the inside , the disaster areas . we helped for the first sentences , looking for rescue and rescue .
if i do that , i don &apos;t contaminate the original details , and on the contrary , i could write this story here .
you &apos;re kept back from public opinion .
it &apos;s not very good .
and which of them is a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : what country is better , china or india ?
because the indian man in life expectancy has an advantage over two years to the indian woman .
in terms of political change , they &apos;ve introduced village elections .
china , i think , still has some remarkable , uncut foundations -- especially in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality that we don &apos;t have in india .
it was a place where people came together with all sorts of different locations and different knowledge areas came together and removed .
and now they have the problem that they &apos;ve spent all the money to do this with this advanced electronics in these countries , and now everything is not useful .
a little bit of a chaotic environment , where there probably many ideas came from , where people had more interesting , interesting , unpredictable conversations -- people of different origins .
about a decade ago , a wonderful scholarship went to the name of howard gruber and read darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they &apos;re exploring their colleagues , but everyone said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think i was doing it .
does it go the other way around ?
in the 1970s , the one percent &quot; 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors can be summarized roughly in the category of &quot; crony capitalism , &quot; political outbreaks that help a group of well-connected , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
while you &apos;re just observing how globalization and technological revolution create this global rule of money , it &apos;s much more difficult to rate the whole thing .
so they invest unprecedented amounts of time and resources to educate their children .
we &apos;ve created the modern social state .
this is his little hand .
one of them is that we will all die .
this was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed in a new development .
in fact , i believe that in places like oregon , where you can take medical response and swallow a toxic dosis , only half a percent people have ever done it .
so , a long story short , they came to canada .
but i also heard about cancer as the most dreadful disease of our time , how did the best and the bad thing put together ?
some articles actually went so far to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only for cancer , but against the fact that metastases have spread into skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! so that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscles , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- which suggests that skeletal muscles may be able to control angiogenesis , to control the tumors that make these blood vessels .
this is a very broader idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
and then i left my translator .
she was the girl who , in the breaks , chose for her team .
and right after that , i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a 11 year-old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from all over korea , and he found families for them .
they pasted a lot of time about the dictionary .
so i open the window , and i look out , and i see how flame is shooting from the side of the hotels to the height . the hotel is burning .
so we ran into the bath , we took towels and we held them in front of our faces and the children .
until the adoption is through . a year ! what does it take that long ?
this is her cochteacher .
this is sydney , who &apos;s going to be three years old in a few days .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there are larger planets , there are big planets , ok .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on each planet ?
and that deep thing , underlying point is that science is redefining life as we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here to there .
thank you very much .
look , while uganda decreases and zimbabwe decreases russia to one percent .
they find the highest hiv rates in the world in africa , and yet they find in senegal , down here , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya here .
it may be that it &apos;s something else , so the transmission is more common .
we know that about 106 billion people have ever lived .
it wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter period than it was in germany .
it &apos;s the same with institutions .
they just have to give me food . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions about the future billion , just before 2016 , when the united states is losing its place as number one economy to china .
no , i think we &apos;re going to get through , regardless of the enormous high school burden that we &apos;ve collected , regardless of the indication that we &apos;ve lost our work morality and other parts of our historical elans .
niall , thank you .
there are lots of spider silk .
spider silk is almost entirely made of protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider are quite diverse .
also , spider silk has a high potential because of their ability to rocket defense .
what i &apos;m interested in is not the mermaid parade , as lovely as it might be , but it may be on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographers .
that sounds alien in our ears , but ultimately what happens is that 80 percent of the contributors below average have contributed a lot .
the first thing that happens is that if you have an institutionalized problem , the first goal of the institution immediately transforms from whatever goal for self-preservation .
inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states trying to figure out if blogger journalists are or not .
it was created by analyzing their communication patterns , the use of many of these tools , by no doubt , the intelligence agencies in the world today do the same work for the attacks in the last week .
you have kleie , which is probably the healthiest part of the bread or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because there are fibers .
everything is in its place . first level .
we call it gare .
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the point of view of the possible connections to a deeper level -- my search is only about the answer to the question , &quot; what is so special bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and when they &apos;re modeled , they go back to prove that they &apos;re alive and they &apos;re developing character .
if you make this bread , you can use any kind of stavers of any beer .
it &apos;s going to be kind of a refrain while we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes a very , very long time to write these scores , and right now i &apos;m working on a piece that &apos;s 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;m going to get the hair .
it &apos;s done by brian mcwhorter , who &apos;s an extraordinary artist .
that gives you a little taste of the piece .
what we did -- betty rapacholi , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two boats with food : a bowl with a commodity broccoli and a bowl with leckfish crackers .
i mean , at the end of the day , when we look at babies on the surface , they appear to us quite useless .
and our babies and our children are much longer dependent on us than any other species babies .
the fund gets them to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
boy : that .
our consciousness about this thing becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else becomes dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the research and development division of human species , &quot; the psychologist alison gopnik says how babies do research , how babies get raffin information and make decisions .
if i could just borrow for a little demonstration for a moment to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
and then you repeat this process over and over and over again , until something that &apos;s useful -- in this case , the character is supposed to run out , like me , straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that before .
so here &apos;s a few simple scenes that he &apos;s going to enter .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it anyway .
some studios already use our software to do that , and we &apos;re going to soon get to see some of our stunt men in a couple of big film productions .
we thought he was just going to have the balance .
here you learn to go on the potches -- as i hope most of you will know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are absolutely essential for developing empathy .
if you &apos;re ever lonely , you write a new york times column , you get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;m getting today is reported by frustration .
but some stories are just classic , and yet they &apos;re so upgraded .
it was sank . nobody ever bought it .
there &apos;s a limit we don &apos;t want to cross . so what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new empty document in word -- that could happen !
but i think there are actually two microsofts .
the other products have been supported by microsoft with open standard , rather than apple &apos;s company &apos;s standard .
and remember , when someone writes to me a hassletter -- what happens every day -- i say , &quot; leck me . &quot;
but when i looked at the more powerful technologies , nanotechnology , genetic technology and others coming up in terms of digital technologies , i was very worried about the abbrevic potential .
and to limit the danger of these new things , we ultimately have to limit the ability of individuals that basically divide them access to pandemic power .
i think the challenge we face -- i &apos;m very sure this is going to happen -- the challenge is : are we going to create these materials with the background that will allow us to use this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , like football forms , they have all kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last of little fund -- he &apos;s belief at 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s quite remarkable for us .
and if you apply the concept of insurance broader , you can deliver a much more powerful instancy -- the constitution of the market -- to use feedback .
12 years ago , caves started to fascinate me , and i shifted my research in this direction .
so wonderful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice underneath the surface .
so they &apos;re a much slower form of life .
in fact , there &apos;s so much energy for biology in this cave that there &apos;s actually a large number of cave fish .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have a lot of properties used to be used by the people and other organisms earlier as a habitat .
whenever you make a goal , you have to set certain steps , certain steps , certain struggling to be taken .
and so it &apos;s also in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
fakes have been painted about it , and it has been suffered from rigid jellyfish .
so before we could start to digitize the archimic , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but when the electrons fly around at the speed of light , they give off x-ray radiation .
this was a bad idea , because philip of macedonia had a son called alexander the great , and she lost the battle of chaironeia .
because right now , institutions limited their data with copyright constraints and so forth .
the original owner of the bottle was one of the most enthusiastic wizards of the 18th century .
i wondered : 160 dollars for what ?

i mean , it &apos;s a freely handle , knock-free toilet .
there was an object i couldn &apos;t get my fingers , and that was the 1947 cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste of a banal -- so it &apos;s not necessarily important that i was not impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one with that reaction .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid was sold for 30,000 real dollars .
what &apos;s really interesting about virtuality is you can measure it .
well , i could design a game called beecraft by just getting a million pies or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do a lot , but in a game we &apos;ll say , &quot; ok then . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and virtuality in it .
and i want to tell you a quick story , so 1999 -- there was a video game called everquest .
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed through the psychological and neurological insights that we get when we watch people play .
it &apos;s a kind of fossilized toothbg , which is officially labeled as a dental dental .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m completely obsessed with food .
there is definitely hunger in america , 49 million people and nearly 16.7 million children .
and their farms are also big .
it &apos;s the 30th anniversary of transformed grain and of the big gulp , of chicken mcnuggets , highly concentrated fructosemized maisrup , the agricultural crisis in america and the change of the way that agriculture has gone internationally .
this is a aid i got two years ago , and this was one of the great projects that i and my company had ever been involved in .
but i &apos;m just limited to the beginning of the process , to three very pedantic statements .
if we &apos;re so good , what we &apos;re doing , shouldn &apos;t we be able to create an architectural manifestation that looks absolutely ruthless through the future and project-page bottlenecks ?
the architectural implementation was , quite frankly , dude .
and this is the actual wage of the struggle .
the second technology that we put in , we use things that you know about the silk banks of an opera .
here you see the flat configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk today about collecting stories in something unconventional .
one of these projects is about a year and a half old .
these are the images that are automatically created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a timeline showing you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s bartenwal . well , go on .
a 28-year-old inhaber of a mobile business .
an 80-year-old , more educated farmer .
what if she found the truth after just a year , what would she do for the next 35 years of her life ?
&quot; make money and open a store &quot; was the indian street worker .
during the anesthesia , he told them that he wanted to be there , and he had given me about two percent chance of survival .
don &apos;t get me wrong , writing has benefits .
with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in steno , and then communication is limited .
very funny people , if lol means that .
you don &apos;t do that .
if any of us had seen a black board in 1993 , it would have been a little bit different since the time of love story , he would have understood what was there .
i &apos;m talking about time , i just wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week at whitney biennal , and also in the bitforms gallery in chelsea .
afghanistan is not an existential threat to the global security .
and the same is true for the troops .
instead , there was a litany of amazing optimism .
diplomats disappear in bottomes .
and finally , we have to understand that the secret of what we did in bosnia and kosovo was the secret of our success for the great part of our humility -- in the careful way we engaged our commitment .
rory , they mentioned libya at the end .
so here &apos;s two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger , to basically show you what it looks like .
there are test stripes that are coming in , but if you look at these test stripes , they &apos;re used for a different kind of urinanalysis .
the selective problem . this is a difficult problem for reasons i won &apos;t be enlightened .
there &apos;s another very interesting connection here , and this is that what you want to do is extract valuable information to keep on going through a generally fairly bad telephone system .
so , i think it &apos;s the minimum we can probably achieve to make things .
and we &apos;ve decided that we should not be thinking about this very much in terms of the cost , but we should think about simplicity .
there &apos;s a book called , &quot; what &apos;s the matter of kansas ? &quot;
so we have to ask why .
but inevitably , you &apos;re not much interacting with people who are not as you are yourself .
so we can think of things like the road trajectory .
i &apos;m kidding , but only half when i say that no one will believe you in the hospital if you arrive with a missing limb , without predicted cat scan , mri and orthopedic consultation .
and then bell turned to his students .
within a few years in the late 19th and early 20th century , suddenly the physician was trying to do a diagnosis , the barbeer .
between the perception of the patient and the physician in terms of the best possible medical care is a real dissent .
another experience i did in texas , before i went to stanford , influenced me .
the bad news : the accurate cause we don &apos;t know . see ? you can do that , we can do that . &quot;
i remember so many large , sophisticated eyes tracking up at this ritual .
some call us groomers , a rather unfriendly term .
in this case , we &apos;ve checked this .
for you back there , it says , &quot; then a miracle happened !
and there were neither to 1655 .
religious iconography .
more difficult is to move the dead to an answer .
my friend simon singh , a particle physicist , no more dozent , wrote the book &quot; the big bang &quot; and so on .
and now they open their eyes .
you can completely open it , and it &apos;s hydrostatic .
but it really inspired me to think that these guys , at least most , know what they &apos;re doing for a living .
everybody thought that was impossible .
you can make a lot of change . you can build roads .
and this is something that people want from jeher .
you don &apos;t need everyone .
hugo chavez didn &apos;t invent the unhappy worker and middle class in venezuela . he just led her .
and so it goes on and on .
they connect people together .
the reason ? the modern modern medicine is using a 60 year-old approach .
there &apos;s another catch .
this makes it 168 times faster , over 25,000 times cheaper , and over 400 times more sensitive than our current standard test for pancreatic cancer .
but my experiences with the islamic world are quite different .
there are , for example , the character of noora .
and why does sex lead to babies , and why does babies mean an erotic disaster in relationships ?
because it &apos;s the secret of erotics .
most importantly about this description of the other or myself -- that &apos;s the same thing -- is particularly interesting that there is no need in desire .
this is their rotation and angelpoint , which is biology , the natural instinct .
and then you start the desire . this exploration requires curiosity , and discovery .
you know that there &apos;s an erotic space that belongs to everybody alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
it &apos;s usually played in smaller rooms .
so early hip hop groups have cut together some places .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for creation , these adaptations that we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; that &apos;s up to me !
how do we solve the three problems that i want to bring to the language here ?
albert einstein -- i was just talking to somebody when i was giving a talk at princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what is life about ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a lecture or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people .
he was talking about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rarely has declined such a powerful spirit with so great humility of the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he said .
i &apos;m not going to talk about murdering nor the suicidal murderer .
but you have to stand for about 10 minutes and take a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i never was in .
harvest baby teeth .
with tears in the eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
in 2010 , a young woman stands before president sirleaf and says , how you and her siblings live together , her parents died in war .
we go to rural areas , and everything we do , how it happened in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i want to look back 20 years from now on , and see that there &apos;s another liberian girl , a ghanaian , nigerian , ethiopian girl standing on this ted stage .
lg : you &apos;d like to happen .
licklider recognized computers can do the necessary routines to prepare insights and choices .
every interaction is recorded by more and more sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer . it &apos;s a lot of data , and we get the opportunity to understand our existence .
these instructions were human consequential formats .
by bringing in a more enhanced process , which is otherwise a task for 40 people over three months , became a simple task for three people in 40 hours , all of which are vivity of human-computer symbiosis .
we should stop watching outside .
for dinner with my wife and children , they go home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t have time to get fit ; you want to get sick .
she became a much larger dog when i thought .
these effects are all of us .
the boom of the national railroad station came together to our problems .
think of bike stores , beverages .
in the era of katrina , we have more in common .
and you &apos;ve probably all done that , and if not , you &apos;re going to have to .
help me make green for the new black , help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this was an opportunity to use scratch to make an interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical of what this terminus goes on .
in this case , you take a movement block , you put it on a pile and the stack of blocks determining the behavior of the different characters in a game , or a story , in this case , the great fish .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
when kids like victor are creating projects like this , they &apos;re learning important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today to give you a background is the idea that cars are art .
i want to talk about this .
and i think that this idea that great cars inhabit a soul is very useful . you all know that . you see a car with soul at first sight . you know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite paintings that really describes our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided it was cheaper , instead of being a studio and six or seven apartments , elizabeth taylor &apos;s former house in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think that we were very close to each other that day , we were disconnected unnecessary threads , and we rented the concept of true teamwork and creativity .
we didn &apos;t take him to boston .
because i just have a little lab .
now we &apos;ve done clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of sales and marketing people who can position us this pharmaceutical substance in the market .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you have to think about is that we have to do with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with a hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explain was why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to that , at least we have a good theory that can explain this if this theory is true , and that the theory of dark energy .
and so even though the universe is persisted forever , and ordinary matter and radiation are going to be curved , there is always a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also have large fluctuations .
it &apos;s cooling down .
it &apos;s a reckless fact in the universe that you have to accept and not question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to take something to all of those out there , like me , to say , to the africans and the poor who are struggling with their dreams .
no matter what the movement i did in my real world was just replicated with my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my bicycle helmet , and i put it in a little bit of dirt , which the projector would do well .
the camera , interestingly , understands not only my movements , but it &apos;s also able to understand what things i &apos;m holding in my hand .
and why only combat ? we can just play with paper .
all the work you &apos;ve seen is all about my learning in india .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
this is going to be the third largest park in rio since june this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep underground to build a stop .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
almost every year , we have these terrible prints .
we are below the average in terms of traffic disorders in the city .
one city of the future is a city that doesn &apos;t make a city from this great community , which are cities .
the best answer is to try and reconstruct a darwin &apos;s creation story of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is to make them beautiful , so that they excuse a kind of attraction , so that they &apos;ll get joy to just watch them .
and some of them are too big in any case to use them for battles .
our powerful response to images , the expression of feelings in art , the beauty of music in front of the night sky will be with us and our progeny as long as human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try and explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here what the computer looks like , and since you can &apos;t see the vibration , we actually have the driver with red leds , so he can really see what &apos;s going on .
let &apos;s see if mark can avoid it .
or for blind people , in everyday tools , in household education and in the office .
a subtle engineering process had begun , and the implication that ordinary people don &apos;t hear voices , and i heard it was that something could not agree with me .
my mental health state was a catalyst for discrimination , replacements and physical and sexual surgeries , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , they &apos;d be better off because cancer is easier to heal than schizophrenia . &quot;
now , to paraphrasize chavez : if social change starts , it can &apos;t be stopped .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now .
so what i &apos;m proposing is that it &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than mars , although mars , of course , is a lot of promising and interesting place .
and the ordinary astronomers were full of contempt about it .
because it meant that the kind of life that can live out there has enormous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another object , this lovely piece of furniture with creatures and water stores and naked stuff -- quite creepy stuff for a little kid .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology , and they might turn them into things that people would use in a new way , and maybe find a new functionality .
the other thing that humanistic is about jawbone , is that we decided to let the whole technological gadgets away , this whole nerd stuff , and tried to make it as nicely as possible .
so we called it y water . so this is another example where everything comes together in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the evolution of the brand , it &apos;s all intertwined .
this is my neffe anthony , switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to take it back . it was hard to take it back .
yves behar : the design of objects that tell stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly delightful and brilliant woman , became witwe early .
she was the determined advocate for women &apos;s rights that i &apos;ve ever heard .
look at these young girls who go back to school after acid was put into their faces . &quot;
the world that layma boas had been given was a world in war .
then the situation gets excited .
they have to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation who grew up in a world where everything is out of paper , and some of our best conversations have happened on a screen .
in the end , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
and if you &apos;re surprised why this is even interesting , you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that &apos;s more strict between gender .
maybe some things are bad traditions , and they need changes .
so let me give you an example : in turkey , where i come from , which is a very over-secular republic , we had something that i call secular musm police , which should be described to the universities against hiding students .
now , if i were the only person who thinks that , then we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , when muslims have seen europe as an example , they were independent , more secure .
that &apos;s why the eu process , the efforts of turkey , who joined e.u. , in turkey , was supported by the beautiful muslims , while some non-religious nations were supported about it .
there &apos;s a very large nose , and it &apos;s not anxiety of it as if it &apos;s connected to anything specific .
if scientists today , a century later , want to make neurons visible , let them light up from the inside , instead of evaporating them .
carl schoonover : insights into the inside of our brain
but this trend is not so ambiguous .
but for many parts of africa , a colleague was so formulated by me , &quot; the ceasefire stand on the tuesday evening was just agreed at the right time , so that the genocide could start at the wednesday morning . &quot;
and instead of packing this opportunity , local and international leaders soon moved back and left themselves from the second intimate , the events of the 09 . september 2001 and wars in afghan san and in iraq . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
institutional design requires a strong focus on the problem-asking , innovative thinking and adaptive , powerful implementation .
the stromatolites are the heroes of my story .
in shallow seas , it unfolded early on , and that &apos;s where it turned into more complex shapes .
flamingos moved across continents . the great hike started .
some of the mammals returned to the water .
everybody should have an opportunity to have a luxury .
but there was nothing for this purpose , so we married mustache grow with prostate cancer , and then we created our motto , which is , &quot; change the health of the man &apos;s health . &quot;
mo bros from canada , from the united states , and from england , mailing us and calling us and saying , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing here for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year we &apos;ve been lucky to have 450,000 promi-ambassadors . &quot;
this kind of entertainment , getting men involved in this , in every age , is so crucial and important , and i think it &apos;s so much more important than the money we collect .
he could see what happened to his forest , his environment , because his grandfather took him under his fittiche when he was just two years old , and started teaching him about the forest and the way of his people &apos;s lives .
when i was thinking about it , i wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren would answer if they asked the same question .
we need new models to be a leader and human world .
she works with people like murali krishna .
for a lifetime , through everything about the cultural revolution , and everything that came after , he gathered today about eight million parts of his museum , documenting contemporary chinese history .
it just happens .
&quot; my world &quot; is subjective .
or maybe he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock and staring at the sky , and the sun and the moon .
and if you lived an extraordinary life , you &apos;re going to get to the elysium , or what the french call it , &quot; the champs-élyes &quot; -- the sky of the heroes .

you see , this is india today , the basic notion of reality is based on a cyclical picture .
you know , he &apos;s set up the biggest buy chain called &quot; big bazaar . &quot;
&quot; why i chose that path , why i don &apos;t care about the passes , just hide me , please . &quot;
devdutt pattanaik opens the eyes for a new way of looking at the myths of india and the west -- and shows why these basic systems of god &apos;s belief , the transition with death and that idea help us understand each other , consequently misunderstood .
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost 2012 and the world to say , &quot; i am completely and absolutely competent , &quot; is to defeat itself with the weakest lob .

her friends and family are going to accumulate at the cemetery , and there , on her grave , a tombstone is written , &quot; here is an excellent engineer who invented velcro . &quot;
they &apos;re very happy . this is the conversation that moms and fathers want to hear , because your child is good at math , and you know what &apos;s next .
that &apos;s because they -- they know what they are .
i didn &apos;t have a patents , and i never got any money from a medical imaging worker , and i &apos;m not going to make sure you choose me .
so how do you know that your breast is high density ?
ultrasound has more biopsies to the outline that are unnecessary in relation to other technologies , and it &apos;s not very common .
if you find a tumor , as long as it &apos;s less than one centimeter , the survival rate is over 90 percent , but it &apos;s massively with the tumor sizes .
the image of the mbi shows this tumor much clearer , just like a second tumor , that makes a lot more powerful on the surgical possibilities of the patient .
it costs a radiologist years of special training to become an expert at distincting a regular anatomical detail from a concern that &apos;s an appalling thing .
some women who get sick of breast cancer many years later , and fortunately most of them survive .

this is a gorgeous vision .
it &apos;s a question of the consequences .
so let &apos;s get to the point .
what did i do ? did i hear on my belly ?
that &apos;s interesting . that &apos;s a different way of thinking .
the homunculus is basically a visualization of a human being where every body part is proportionate to the surface that it takes in the brain .
this is white noise .
and db is probably going to roll in your direction .
i just did that for making money .

occasionally , i meet with scientists .
and so i had hope that , by putting some natural elements in , a little bit of fog , i could make the space tangible .
vertefiable means that it makes a difference whether you do something or not .
the large mountains in the distance are moving less .
how do we create an idea that is both tolerant to individuality , and also to collective activity without polarizing the two in two different directions ?

this is a picture of me and my daughter holding an israeli flag .
&quot; because it works , make a poster with me . &quot;
they came and it was so many . one day , i remember michal was talking to a journalist , and i said , &quot; who &apos;s going to see this ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;

we often make little films .
what i &apos;d like to talk about is the biggest problems in the world .
but it &apos;s a problem , of course , if you ask people to focus on problems .
so what i &apos;m looking at is really saying that for a very long time , we &apos;ve had a situation where we &apos;ve had a number of choices .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it says that what we can do about it is very little , too high cost .
the precondition of malaria is what &apos;s going on to some million infected a year .
what &apos;s happening here is that we think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a good movie in terms of how i &apos;m sure i want to see it , it &apos;s true , but don &apos;t expect emmeri to make in his next film brad pitt into tanzania or something like that .

its power to create wealth and greater freedom is impacted . &quot;
secondly , china has managed to broadcast the unequal income distribution without changing the political scaffolding .
freedom house found that even though 50 percent of all countries today are democratic , 70 percent of them are repressive , in terms of people don &apos;t have rede- or travel freedom .

is the internet actually a place you can go to ?
and the landscape changes . three years ago , when i started doing this , there was only a cable running along the african west coast here in this map of steve song as a thin black line .

this data is sent layer layer layer by layer to the device , starting with the base of the product , and it lays layer upon layer on layer on layer by putting the new layer of material on an additional process on the old layer .
it was made by depositing layers of about four micrometers .
a repulsion is less likely .
you can just make it right in front of a place .
this is where the product is made .
without any doubt , i believe that this technology will create a revolution in production and the landscapes as we know it will change .
he was worried that , if he called it in this name , especially out , in the public , you could think that he was going to take a sense of jihad .

i was with my friend , susan meiselas , the photographer , in the mathare valley slums .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty wasn &apos;t the bad thing . it was the humility and the embarrassment of the whole thing . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m going to miss the violence or the drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
first of all , instead of months that are going to fly by and forget , time was much more lonely .
but it &apos;s less likely you will be .
and for my first year , i kept running my company forward .
in fact , it &apos;s being said that more energy is needed to make a solar cell than it &apos;s going to be embedded in its entire worktime .
solar cells , but for four and a half hours , collecting light .
and it &apos;s also very high pressure , and it &apos;s because of this dangerous thing .
this is a heat engine .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , which has the generator and all the cabling in it , and this is the hot cardboard , the hot cylinder at the top end -- that part gets hot , this one &apos;s cold , and it comes out electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can also cool down .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a birth right to use that energy as quickly as we do right now .
we inflate it up and we look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying laboratory with which we did the measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i was still writing bad poems , and he never chased the math building in the air , but he went to cuba .
so , from insight , great things can emerge -- -- of which i then take a picture that will eventually land in my work .
i work for the new yorker , and i make front pages , and then 9 / 11 came , and that was , uh , a complete end of the world as we knew them .
and they said , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re wrong ! be fuzzy with the tongue , but so that we can understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that his toppeople had to go extinct . &quot;
this man is angry , because somebody around his staircase has spread around , and basically -- you know , weighs seem to be a topic here .
and she &apos;s also run out with george gershwin , so i don &apos;t think so .
td : for my youngest childhood and after that , i &apos;ve been admitted to a lot of different obligations , and when i was young , it always occurred to me that my path was already written .
that &apos;s beautiful , but we should also remember that a similar process should also run on the inside .
td : lakshmi worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let alone all sorts of things you &apos;ve been doing so that &apos;s happening , and i &apos;ve been pretty resistant sometimes , and i &apos;ve been nervous all this week .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned in the simulation , and others who &apos;ve learned it really .
when i say , &quot; we , &quot; i mean the council of relations .
but nobody thinks that it &apos;s actually going to be very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the bush administration spending is actually more of the connection with anthrax and the threat of bioweapons .
we know that the virus will mutate . it will be a different virus .
but in the scientific community , there &apos;s a heated debate about what percentage of the flu transmission between people and hat and how much is happening about their hands .
some of the poorer countries that have the most experience of h5n1 have , there are full of drugs that have already gone down .
and i think even our leaders would say , in this case , we still have a lot to do .
i &apos;m very pleased to answer their questions .
our centers for disease control have one of them developed tests -- as fast diagnostics .
and in humans , in the recent h5n1 cases , similar bacterial infections were also not a problem .
not only do you pay attention to how much fun you have with it , but also how the mobility completely changes the way you interact with a city like san francisco .
please put a swiss minute with me .
i become friends with a young juggler from a troops , and he agrees to sell me three clubs .
so since i was a childhood , i was playing with ropes and climbers , so the case is done . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a wireless artist .
manhattan is no longer reaching to the infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to juggle here , right ?
i &apos;m staying in the middle .
she turned one , got me on the triumph .
because of the surplus leaves and branches , it &apos;s very dark in the bottom and very quiet .
i and my colleagues in the canopy research are interested in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest .
we &apos;re advising with the media about canopy questions ; we have a canopy newtter ; we have mailinglists .
and then the students came to our recording studio , and they took their own rapsongs with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn to grow the frog rana pretiosa , which is a highly endangered amphibie in the states of washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; look what you &apos;ve hided in front of you . &quot;
that &apos;s why we see a rising demand for information access , and therefore .
they &apos;re not magicians . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
that day , i learned two really important things .
the deeper we go underwater , the higher the pressure is .
so i started this in about 15 years ago .
breathing the air goes into the breathing lung , breathing the air comes out of the lung .
each of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them elevate , there are still reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat is expanding and expanding , lots of miles .
so sharks are not as dangerous as most people are doing it .
when we found it , we weren &apos;t even sure what family he belongs to , so we called him dr. seuss-fish , after the child writer , because he looked like this , when he came out of one of his books .
oxygen toxicity caused a crap and it drank .
this means that each and every one of you here knows at least one child who &apos;s suffering from a developmental disorder .
and his communication and social interaction improved so markant that he could visit a normal school and even became a karate superstar .
it &apos;s kind of like life : once you &apos;re in there , you can &apos;t turn out again .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him , but remember this day , one day you &apos;re going to hear about him , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he &apos;s died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved everybody .
we , all of us , are what happens when a gas soup of hydrogen and helium evolves so long that it starts to wonder about its origins .
these extreme aid prove that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to appreciate the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet in the first step , to make a contact with life elsewhere in space .
it turns out that silicon is as important as aluminum , and we &apos;re going to build it in the future by expanding it to 350 antennae so it &apos;s more sensitive and to balance the moore &apos;s law of increased computing .
and then we &apos;d like to improve the automated search through human paradigm .
many people say it &apos;s the best place in the world to study climate change .
every cylinder is a time parfate .
while you &apos;re hanging with the ice , you &apos;re going to heat up an extra pair of gloves in an oven so that you can attract a new pair of hands if your workshops are freezing and your fingers are going to grow .
i believe in this place there is a little bit of economic history .
and our soldiers are not pleased to be a darueber , on pipelines in farwegistan wache , when they were actually reported to service to accuse american buerger .
you can do it even further , and you can almost triple the efficiency with some functional improvements , and you can double the winning of the large species .
we could build big cars , we could build things that would make security , but they should be easy .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan , because we have access to protecting our maize farmers and the others don &apos;t .
and that is , by making the military step to the very benign mass production of these kinds of materials , or in this case , to manufacture ultralight steel , as good graduate technology ; the military can do it as it used as the darphet to the internet .
it can &apos;t just act by a giant sexistic conspiracy .
there are two types of negative feedback that we &apos;ve received .
we hope it &apos;s going to be really stable .
hoppla , i &apos;m wrong .
and he ended up finding a handler , a dutch craftsman named han van meegeren , who sold him a wonderful vermeer to a prize that is now cheating about 10 million dollars .
according to his biograph , &quot; he looked like he had been discovering for the first time that there are bad things in the world . &quot;
&quot; it depends on it . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive you find them how much you sexually move or romantic is critical of what you think you &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects has a value beyond what it brings you , because of its story .
but i don &apos;t want a copy , even though i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to take his million-dollar spirits in a subway station in washington d.c. , to put himself in a corner and see how much money he &apos;s going to take in .
the second shock hurts less , because you get a little bit used to it .
and if you keep reading , you can see that there may be some kind of political value behind it .
she &apos;s praying that she &apos;s a certified professional member of the american compound of food consultants , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat vegetables and olive oil have fewer skin wrinkles .
the placeboeffect is one of the most fascinating things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a precise conclusion , if you give a drug in such high dose , that there &apos;s going to be more side effects , and your new drug will look better .
the great attempts are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem where there is no solution to this moment .
and very soon they would have started transporting this coal , tonne around tonne , zugwagon to zugwagon , bootsladung around booting , back to china and anywhere in the world .
can you imagine how you feel if you were in my place ?
it &apos;s about oil ; you know , everybody knows that .
there &apos;s this thing , the militarization of the world , and it comes right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
man , the americans , are kind of like this , &quot; ah , clubs .
these christians are knocked .
they generalize . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and all the other is chinese .
can you imagine that maybe one of them would bent down to his child in the morning and hug it and say , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back .
everything has changed .
and all of this has had tremendous implications in the world .
i think thomas jefferson really captured this in words very well .
for the hollywood people in the audience , it &apos;s so even explaining why action-films have a bigger budget than comedy , and that &apos;s because action-films make themselves easier to translate into other languages and cultures . so the market is bigger for these films .
but it &apos;s going to happen in this century .
this is not the united states per capita gdp , which is going to be over a million , but the gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
also , as everyone here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the pinnacle of a lifelong commitment that grew up on the gulf coast of alabamas on florda-peninsula .
a lot of our actions on this planet that relate to our living environment are only by belief and guessing .
one has been around for thousands or millions of years .
we have to calm down before we ruin the planet .
e. o. wilson : saving life on earth
another key way is the famous european auerox .
the genome of the passenger pigeon contains 1.3 billion base pairs .
the reverse of extinction falls into this category .
real falcons from slightly freshed chicken .
there &apos;s a program on the eco-tourism that &apos;s just brilliant .
this is an emotional topic . some people have stood up .
my grandmother was a housewife .
i also made my own comics , and that was another way of telling stories through words and through images .
and we sat there for a moment , in silence , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . don &apos;t draw your own style .
&quot; better jarrett , i got your postcard .
i &apos;m also going to publish a children &apos;s book called &quot; playpus police squad : the frog who croaked . &quot;
sound always affects us physiologically , psychologically , cognitively and behavioral .
this is a 32 million pounds of teits , major university environments built in england recently designed by a british starty-based architect .
but it &apos;s not just kids that are affected by them .
people who say , don &apos;t have the team sitting next to this team because the noise likes and the other quiet need .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a contemporary businessman who carries his life in the suitcase , and the between dream and reality is not able to unravel both .
344 frames and four and a half years later , what began as a solo show became a collaboration of netty-10 talented actors .
i know theater connects us .
now is the time in which we can use the diversity of our talents to create an intelligent , important and extraordinary work . and overcome .
if you look around in the bathroom , you &apos;ll see some products more , like shampoo , flush , anti-cream cream , body cream , but also toothpaste .
injectable collagen -- or , since the &apos; 70s , collagen of pigs -- is used to inject it into folds .
all in all , i found 185 products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid you have a long and significant year before you . &quot;
i told them they should say this in front of themselves , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
you &apos;ve given me the feeling of being somebody , in a time i felt like a nobody .
they &apos;re just working on the ninth issue , so that &apos;s started in 1930 , and now they &apos;re reaching the letters p .
hundreds of verbs can behave like this .
you can see that as the language of thought , or &quot; mentalese . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why are technologies , polite requests , search and threats so often veiled ?
you can try to imagine what would be if language could only be used literally .
and the other puzzle is i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
here &apos;s my argument . is it halvable ? is it good ?
that &apos;s what makes it opposing . it &apos;s polarizing .
what is it that you gained from convincing me ?
all these different roles . can you imagine an argument you &apos;re participating in , but also in the audience and watching yourself in the debate ?
or -- and this is the fun part for me : we want them to take us into the world of nature . we bring a design challenge , and we find the champions of adaptation in nature that might inspire us .
that changed everything . from there , these engineers weren &apos;t going to return to the boat anymore .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the sandia national lab .
that would be very interesting for fuel cells if they could run out without a platin .
it &apos;s not easy because life only uses a lot of the elements in the periodic system .
feeling and reacting : feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see is you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a cutter . i started under the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia , almost half a million companies are women .
because , like the world wiring forum , smaller gender in direct context , improves economic competitive competitiveness .
and the ones around the world are not exceptions .
people rejected whether this locality and this wonder .
i have a climbing bio-joghurt of happy , self-realizing cows on my work &apos;s surface , and now i want to use kitchen towel to wipe it up .
first of all , we cut it off .
what does that mean ?
when i started working with them , i found that they were incredibly well-adapted .
but the researchers had a problem .
until finally , they graduated from graduating and left the campus -- and certainly happy to get there -- some time later , came back and realized that the crows were still remembered them .
we found that they &apos;re really smart , and they can teach each other things .
so squirrel , for example , would come by , look for peanut and go back .
but there were three problems , three puzzles i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about that , but more importantly , i found a problem proposal .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because every region has something .
let me make the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the mass audience in the future . you have to understand that .
that &apos;s way too simplistic .
oh yes , i &apos;m going to be the johnny appleseed of the notes .
there &apos;s about 10 million phages each .
and over here , with the words of radiologist israel meisner , &quot; as the hand reaches the penis in a way that reminds the power movement . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i &apos;d prefer to stop eating if you don &apos;t have anything . &quot;
and i said , &quot; you should do an experiment .
he had a line in his book that was allegedly from the habsburg monarchy , and there was a kaiserin maria theresia , who had difficulty with the receiver .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read them what she said , because i think it &apos;s so beautiful .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . it &apos;s not because i want to use it . i wanted to see it .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now i would have thought , until this moment , that at the age of 50 , one of the skills i really captured was binding my shoes .
first of all , i have to tell you that i &apos;m not from here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to really know where to draw the different colors .
but i can see in their faces that they &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; innamed &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have a little fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i was stretching a couple of things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all in here .
so my father was one , so my youth was so interesting .
the song as just a fact .
and i go , &quot; now , is it good , i &apos;m going to put the wheels on . &quot; from pure protest , i bought the peculiar wheels , and i built them and -- look at it . could i please have my special illumination ?
it just sounds , but i think we have a huge problem in our society and culture with intensity .
he had designed the probe himself , and he was really proud of it .
boy , i love the thing .
the consequences of a planet on which there are seven billion people already .
specifically , he was in the convenient seat , the real convenient seat that he had presented to his triumphy cart , and the beautiful french around the seat .
intent -- a life with intention -- consciously lived to sing the original something better .
i saw the healthy mass of a left deltamuskels , and i dreamed that she was lost , dreamed of all the things i hadn &apos;t done yet , but it was not possible anymore .
and then i began , as many times before , to ask , how would my life have been different if this man wouldn &apos;t have hurt me if my genes had a different portion of experience ?
i was , but i was now , despite an impaired myself and that , i suspect , i now made myself myself .
i &apos;d been hoping for something much simpler : to swap this turkish dessert against four words and make me back on my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his truck guide for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine perception laboratory at the university of california , san diego .
first , the perception of people , and secondly , a natural interface , a natural form of service , so that the interaction with the robot gets more intuitive for you .
and yet , i came up with this idea .
after i realized that economic danger , i thought we need to find a solution to this problem .
some of them have even reviewed the speakers , as they talk to nathan myhrvolds , or that one of tim ferriss that might be considered occasionally as a prospect .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that includes that .
this time i paid 25 cents , because i thought the task was a little harder .
and yet , there was one thing that everybody was sure about : the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in mind , because i &apos;m going to give you three key facts about string theory .
the candidates list went up to about 10 to 500 .
and he worked for decades to explain that number , but he didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes has more dimensions .
because the astronomers of today , by applying mighty telescopes to the sky , discover a handful of high-informative photons -- a kind of cosmic telegram , billions of years out .
now , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of this is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
remember , it &apos;s the first time you meet it . we want to get them really excited and do some curiosity .
he said , &quot; go , milo . squash it . &quot;
pm : this is the right dimitri .
we don &apos;t know anybody here .
the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the tv set , armed men are out on the road , there are roads .
it was a very grim meeting of the reporters who worked in the war , the staff of aid organizations , and of course the courageous people of sarajevo themselves .
if i &apos;m asked why i &apos;m going to go on the cover , why i &apos;m going to stay there , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my profession to make this testimony , and that &apos;s the krux , the core of the thing for us to reporter .
even before a goal is to be able to deal with the joystick , controlled cursor , and aurora is trying to find the goal no matter where it is .
and basically , we trained the animals , so they learned to control these avatars and explore objects in the virtual world .
in an experiment we did a few years ago , we went to limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju did the undergraduate .
raise your hand .
the last reason is to do that women are part of the solution , not of the problem .
in the niger , on average , one in seven women die at the birth of a child .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry summers , when he worked as the world bank chefeconomist , once said , &quot; it can be good that investments in girls &apos; education in the developing world will be the highest rentability . &quot;
this is bill easterly &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole vertebrae around one of our traits tells us that there &apos;s a need for education .
and even this image makes the suspect impression of being righted -- like something from barnum &amp; amp ; bailey circus .
one of the possibilities was that we could have moved ourselves back into small family groups .
they put their arrowheads down and they say , &quot; i want to swap these arrowheads against ferocious arrows . we share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where you can meet every three or four miles to a new language .
if 27 individuals from these 27 member states start to sit at a table , blown up their 23 languages , a simple calculation that they need an army of 253 translators to be prepared for all of the pairs .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they also have language .
and what interests me the most is the invisible space between a text and the corresponding image , and how the image is changed through the text , and the text through the image .
these are transatlantic underwater communication caps that are running over the bottom of the atlantic ocean and connecting north america to europe .
they reverse negatively .
but through the idea of phantom imaging , polaroids , faculty photos and attitudes can change stuff statements .
larry youngblood served eight years of a 10-year sentence in arizona , in arizona , for repetition and repetitive use of a 10-year-old boy on a season .
before that , people are leaving themselves .
and they brought them here to us to texas .
and now you &apos;re driving along with the iss where it &apos;s in that moment .
it &apos;s just the length of space that makes it look like this as a business of nothing .
this is what &apos;s called addictive to a feeling : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
and part of that is the inheritance of freuds , the pessimists , who felt the pursuit of happiness , they were driven by infantile aspects of the individual , and could not be found in reality .
a key point in science of happiness is that happiness and unhappiness are not a finite point in a closed continuum .
it starts in the ventral tegentum .
here &apos;s a three weeks old baby .
there &apos;s only one way to increase status in the animal kingdom , which is dominance .
i want to conclude with some quotations .
why should you choose rats ?
and as soon as the rat got that , we get a little harder than that .
you can actually cure twines , even in people who are hiv-positive .
now , knowing that a patient that remains microscopic undetected , up to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- per year , you can be sure that we &apos;ve been saving many lives .
here we see neurons .
so this is important for imitation and emulation .
now the question is : if i just look at how another person is touched , why am i not confused and literally have this sense of touch , how someone is being touched ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
i &apos;m not really about planting , it &apos;s about pollen itself .
all of these pictures were taken by a scanning electron microscope in the lab of kew laboratories .
even every single one of us has a story to tell the pollen fingerprint on us .
we have to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to tackle this crisis .
right at the time in the 1980s , when we saw women and death on heart disease by heart disease , she wrote an editorial article for the new england journal of medicine and called the yentl syndrome .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike computer imaging , x-ray , thallium , for women whose bus is disabled to the heart . every time we organize something that includes a small amount of radiation , we ask , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
well , here we started .
they &apos;ve done what they said , they &apos;ve dreamed language , and they &apos;ve joined campaigns .
the cells have something like this back ; in the dish , they don &apos;t feel hot .
what does that mean for us ?
over the course of three years , we recorded eight to 10 hours a day , collected about a quarter of a million hours of spill and imaging .
this is one of the first facts that came out a little over a year ago that really surprised us .
and finally , my son is playing on a sidewalk .
three of the most important people in this project philip decamp , rony kubat and brandon roy are here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in play .
this is the first time our son did more than two steps once -- captured in the movie .
and that &apos;s an important question to answer , because the better we understand how the brain works , the better we can communicate , i think , the better we can think and work together .
it &apos;s kind of a center where you see a picture and you think , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to what we &apos;ve seen . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is we have our teams to paint the whole strategy plan on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about hygiene , but it &apos;s also the opportunity for relaxation .
so don &apos;t put it in there .
if you translate that into the building industry , if you &apos;ve got a window and you &apos;ve broken a window , we &apos;ll say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , it has to be fixed .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we kept on coming in .
are we just stupid ?
you might be able to flip through it in two years if you read eight hours a day .
so you can stumble in september and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police are waiting for the firefight to cut the vehicle into pieces to get the driver &apos;s body out of the driver .
and that &apos;s till the present with the dollar bill in the united states , where there &apos;s an eye of divine .
all of this leads to -- computing search , just to name this , which is the thing that we do most is we use digital devices .
this is the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right side of the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be discharged from the healthcare system .
he then held my jaw in the right position while he was kief orthopes my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator , who &apos;s fascinated to include gaps in consciousness , whether he gives a dove back to your hearing , or a blind person watching that , or a paralyzed movement .
now , in the dark years , i had to find out what was going on in my mind if anything that was happening today .
and it works . it works .
lp : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were developing countries : they had large families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this side . there &apos;s a big overlap of africa and .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money back to china and brought the land back to a medieval path .
a search function that we can copy the data into a searchable format and publish the world . and what do we hear when we see around us ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin explained life after it came out , but what was the essence of life ?
and there i learned about francis crick .
but there were some in the literature .
we weren &apos;t the best chemists in the room .
i was unhappy ; my girl was not married me .
you can basically compare dna to ordinary segments and due to cancer segments .
and so i &apos;m going to end by telling you that we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
on average , the defense costs two million dollars in this case , and it takes 18 months to get it .
first of all , don &apos;t fight against the patent , but against the stomach .
my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;m going to let them disappear with drill .
&quot; why not ? &quot; the girls said .
the dads were in a place where they could move their daughters to play , put their chairs out and extend their hand to the dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in humans .
the enemy can &apos;t see most of the time , and as a result , we needed a different way to eradicate polio when we had made smallpox .
it &apos;s helped to control pandemic flu , for example , sars .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
and yet , the impossible has happened .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the hardest places from their point of view ?
bruce aylward : how to bring polio kindly to a standstill
dj : we found this individualism now in all kinds of animals , especially in the cats .
and to our surprise , it became a cult movie .
for us , this elephant , in many ways , has become a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of this hope that &apos;s accompanied us in our work .
it was amazingly amazing when she did it safety to protect it from the hyena .
and of course , if i look at this delegation , which is common , it reminds me in an indomestic way , and that &apos;s ironic because your fate is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman , as a community and as part of this planet , and we need to continue with it .
after all , it seems to be obvious that the earth is big and movable , the sun is small and moving , but it &apos;s worth remembering what wittgenstein was going to be .
and that &apos;s because in the middle world of the air resistance is always there .
the nature of this model depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there are so many of them , and because between them , there &apos;s no consensus about their preferential movement , the marmor , as we see them in the middle world , unmoving and solid .
treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophical , but it &apos;s an obstacle of time , if you want to guess what the person is going to do next .
overnight , i became a silent tetraplegician at the ripe age of 40 .
on a cursor that i control with my head , allow me to take these web snippets , see videos of the robot , send commands , by pushing buttons in a web browser .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream happen .
for example , in oceanography , a rule-real lexicon of dolphin language is developed by visualizing basically the radar beams that send the dolphins out .
i think together , we can form a global community .
this is a hot trending topic .
there are now some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from this .
but usually we don &apos;t .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
now that &apos;s down to 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i suppose most of you don &apos;t speak chinese too -- which is really sad when you think that this is now the most common language on the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that too .
if you look at this image , you might think , &quot; why should that care me at all ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and certainty to overcome religious violence and ensure that states would never again commit terrorists subordinated signature again . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and part of that activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war that took 20 million people to live -- until today the most deadly civil war in the world .
lem sen , who is this guy : &quot; i would have made all this money , but i spent all this time looking for the american man who had stolen my recipe .
chinese restaurants , for the most part , did the same thing , i would argue , with the menu and the dekor -- even the restaurant -- but without a centralized headquarter .
in contrast , we got general tso &apos;s chicken that started in fact in new york city in the early 1970s , when i was also starting at the university of new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we see in the 17th century , 18th century is the perpetrated search for medicine beyond copper , making the same thing .
so people would have a really big case .
when the instructions started getting less , i became clearly more depressed , until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember having to appear as a child on any line ?
when i was 18 and 19 , i was sleeping through the night .
over and over again , i &apos;m going to get a bit depressed and a bit obsessive .
and many of us realize that in the next few years there &apos;s a lot to do with building a better world .
he goes around , &quot; what does it feel like to be free ? &quot;
you know . where did the world work with treatment of the known problems that came together from the potential of earthquake and climate change ?
if you pack the impossible , you make it possible .
but we &apos;ve done a agreement on climate change .
and then god cried .
the silk engine does something remarkable : it uses two ingredients , proteins and water that are inside its spinneret , to create a material that is extraordinarily hard to do with technical fibers like texlar .
or you make beautiful things like this , if the camera can catch this .
here you can see it being absorbed by the tissue .
with my new project , marilyn monrobot , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that holds the agreer and applause and the buh-calls -- hopefully not to help him make some of his next decisions .
what do i want to do ? &quot;
in the framework of this unprecedented demonstration , heather knight data , a robotic comic , who can borrow far more than one time -- he collects the feedback of his audience , and he &apos;s looking at the answers of the crowd . does this thing work ?
stanley milgram , inventor of the known six degrees of separation , suspected in the 60 to 70s that there are a compound between two random people that exist a connection between five to seven steps .
how do we think differently about our relations with very disastrous groups ?
there was an incident though that i &apos;m going to tell you about , and where he might have been able to put this fw in the ear .
um ... my father , a secret man ?
it was his father who decided that they needed false papers .
this sense of responsibility of others &apos;s lives , despite his young age of 17 , and also his fault to be a survivor because he had escaped from a camp while his friends were left , he kept his entire life .
and as my half-sister and my half brother believed to be an orphan , my father made false papers .
i asked him , given the victim he had gotten , if he ever counted that .
we are growing from a few million people to the seven billion people we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a regulating biomes on planetary levels , which has one climate change after the next thing , which seems to be a good state .
if you take the forests off , you transcend the limit of land use , you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable .
with the realization of tourist , fishermen , the australian great barrier reef authority and scientists , that the great barrier reef is damn under the current control regime .
but the drama is , of course , that it turns out that small-scale change is not an option .
and that leads to another reason why i &apos;m here today , because i really like media all kinds .
this is a rest of a race from far more sophisticated entertainment .
first , he uses a ancient kind of manufacturing , relief and verband this with a three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technology at that time .
and through the processing of sugar to black paper , i made portraits of them .
it became very large pictures , and i took them up with a very large camera , an 8x10 camera .
i &apos;m interested in acting , particularly bad actress , far enough .
there &apos;s a sequence that happens in the back there as well as the chimps .
so we can ask : is there any general differences between africans and nichtafrians ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of people living today .
we can then ask the same question for denisova-human , like neanderthals : did you mix with the ancestors of today ?
there are a lot of people who escaped their own vision , like this vision from the beginning of the 20th century .
in my belief , the plane of the future has its own consciousness .
imagine carbon nanotubes are growing in the 3d printer , and they &apos;re embedded in an plastic matrix , and they &apos;re following the forces that enter into their components .
they didn &apos;t speak . but most of all , they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them , from their surroundings and from the people .
they would recline . they would call the police .
we now know that it &apos;s about one in 100 .
you &apos;re looking at a video .
you have the sense that the research that you &apos;ve been dealing with can really have an effect on reality that it can actually prevent these experiences that i &apos;ve begun my way out in this field .
then you peel off .
first of all , you conjure in a rigid body position -- chin on the chest leg , arms extended over your reservation chute .
they did everything just like we &apos;d taught them .
and after the battle , they bring these mobile auditoriums and do what &apos;s called &quot; replicating , &quot; to teach you what you did wrong .
also , people have changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this is not a child game .
and she pointed at the left piece to tell me how problematic this image was , that would put it together for you with the idea of how black was represented .
it &apos;s really in this sense of deciding that i have a new set of questions that i ask .
well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement up there .
and the kids said , &quot; how are we going to do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long have you been busy doing this before you decided you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their scores increased to 50 , which is free to redehli &apos;s schools with a trained biotechnology teacher .
was 76 percent . the test , two months later , was the result of 76 percent .
after eight ted leondardo , he wanted to become leondardo da vinci .
that &apos;s 10 years old .
and all of a sudden , i looked out of the darkness on the opposite side of the space , a shiny of mirrors that were punished by the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story to a picture , what would it be ?
now i &apos;m going to show you some clips from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends into a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re mythologies .
i know you can understand that .
so , blue , everything went blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that &apos;s interacting at the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the most sensitive device we have , and find out what price people would pay for it , so that they have the choice .
thank you .
the faulty was this : if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two valves and 10 television sets .
and the little tension of moving away from his trace , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s getting slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models that i &apos;m working with .
the fabric of computational density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually going to be the key to using these models for active research .
thank you .
and the try to fly you just was like trying to shoot a arrow with the fixed end . it was hard work , and boy , boy , i have learned a lot of respect for nature .
now , let &apos;s look at the other side .
we &apos;re working on projects -- even wing developments , as big as swarmer -- with darpa , the california institute of technology and the university of los angeles .
be careful , just behave like wood or something .
now , i didn &apos;t try to be a better metric .
they go on forever .
that &apos;s over two billion .
it takes him for approximately three years of sundays .
don &apos;t forget to take the one off .
but to me , it &apos;s great , because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time that we live in , where human minds and machines can win together .
i have a very clear mass . where does it come from ?
it &apos;s too afraid that the kind of wild trajectory might go extinct in 20 to 30 years .
all evidence indicates that this cancer is transmitted by a virus .
i took the opportunity right , and i took some samples from jonas &apos; tumor and some samples from other body parts .
she brought him to the veterinarian , and this discovered something disgusting .
in the end , cancer is a inevitable consequence of the ability to share and adapt to its environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would pay for it to wait for it .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t feel that the numbers were accumulating them .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the average value for the optimism bias .
but the good news is our illusion isn &apos;t going to break if we &apos;re going to be aware of this hangs .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , step back , to lift more than half of the world &apos;s population and contribute over half of the global economic performance .
you could think of this as the privatization of the war .
after 1958 , the soviets sputnik had shot up , it said , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi , or hanoi , your view of china is going to be slightly different than if you live in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we &apos;re going to bring this into larger historical context , we &apos;re going to be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests , so that it &apos;s not just a zero-sum , but positive sum .
this is the conventional approach .
this one typically has the responsibility to send peacekeepers to guarantee a stable security location .
they depend on each other for the long run .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after most of the time that the law system has collapsed , you can &apos;t even get basic pieces .
the supply would be delivered by your own , after the conflict , the government was building .
this is the silhouette of my hometown of new orleans .
the military understood it . they call climate change a driving factor , which threatens security and stability , while governments in the world are discussing how to react .
it allows them to become more productive , so that over time they can afford insurance themselves .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions , if we feel able to plan for a change world .
listen to chinese students practice english by writing it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that includes things like extracting conventional world with classification , which we &apos;re trying to make abstractions that are trying to make logical consistent , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , which is , we &apos;re more likely to think of what it might be than what it is .
luria looked at people before they entered the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a classification of the concrete world .
and so luria said , &quot; on the north pole , there &apos;s always snow .
they chose albany instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just cognitively demanding professions .
would you have taken it to be killed ? &quot;
you might say a half circle .
it feels like i &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they answered me to do a degree in something .
he &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris managed to get it out with personal sacrifices .
i &apos;m one of their most educational ones .
there &apos;s a prime minister , foreign minister , defense minister and a financial leader , or president of the housing .
boy : &quot; world peace game is serious .
we were all angry at them : &quot; why are you doing that ?
that &apos;s going to be a lot more real if you read it . &quot;
we &apos;ve always been playing the game after school for weeks , about seven weeks , and we &apos;ve essentially mastered all 50 intangible crisises .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
a lot of people announced good paying jobs and joined the national movement .
it &apos;s like its own little connection .
if i cut through all three legs , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a tetrahedron .
so all you &apos;re doing is -- it &apos;s a very provocative thesis -- this old bicycle hose and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; . this fill ventil just goes into an old bike tube .
this is possible if you have a whole piece of paper , din a4 paper -- you can be in a communal school or a national school -- a leaf , a ruler and a pen , no glue .
what we &apos;re doing is a very simple electric engine .
this is a little straw . what you do is you wrap these two corners here , it &apos;s going to be like a baby crocodile .
here are two magnets .
it was a lot of passengers on the ship , and they got bored , so the captain put them on his deck .
at the ink conference , arvind gupta shows simple , and yet amazing plans for turning waste into really entertaining , constructed toys that children can build themselves -- while they &apos;re learning basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology delivered a lot of clues .
and there are some examples of projects that are consciously trying to mimic ecosystems .
and with a little bit of planning , we can maximize a space of traffic into a space that provides open space for people to connect people back to food , and waste into tempts of closed circles .
this photo was taken the day of completion , and just a year later , it looked like this .
when you evaporate seawater , the first thing that &apos;s memorized is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to explore the people of souls with visions removed coolest . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who &apos;s jewish , because i &apos;m jewish and that &apos;s very important to me .
but the real failure was that there were a lot of men who wanted to deal with me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with ourselves .
he likes to travel as long as it &apos;s not on a cruise ship .
i tried to basically be like smilegirl1978 .
because you remember my point system : you have to reach a minimum number of 700 points , and nobody did .
most of you . gamers are 33 years old , not eight years old , and if we look at the high-rate demographics of the computer game , the gamer of tomorrow are older adults .
imagine whose vision is very , very good .
these gamers actually have many other benefits in terms of attention , and one aspect of attention that &apos;s also strongly improved is our ability to pursue objects in our environment .
i &apos;d like to ask you to remember this outcome , and to put it in the context of a different group of technologies , a group that is actually looking up in our society that is made of people doing multimedia-tasking .
let me explain this step with a task called mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just run all sorts of programs of the special case that we &apos;re looking at .
so it was a big , very complex project , and i wasn &apos;t even sure it would work at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and lots of things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with its kind of precision , formaler language and a large network of cargo developed capacity to do a lot of lines with just a few lines .
so , with physical materials , we &apos;re kind of used to walking the world and realizing that certain materials are meaningful for certain technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was quite excited about the discovery that candidates have universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce a special theory of relativity and also give general theory of relativity and gravity and gravity and at least pointing at the quantum mechanics .
sw : i think i do .
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , as teachers that trained me , hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
because my mother was a woman , she had no right to ownership and automatically heard everything my family had , anyway , my father , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony was dancing , we were excited , and we didn &apos;t have slept all night .
he was wearing sneakers and this in a village who didn &apos;t even have fostered roads , and it worked very attractive .
i promised him to be a brave girl , i would come back and do everything you would ask me after that .
if it was pregnant before the marriage , the mother was accounted for it and punished for it .
as we speak here , 125 girls will never be mutilated again .
consumers who represent 72 percent of the american operating are actually beginning to pay precisely like banks and businesses back foreign capital , unleashing their foreign capital , in everyday life , to liberate ourselves from obligations and risks that will encounter us when we move forward .
and finally , what you &apos;re seeing here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we &apos;re actually entering and basically future education , the future children of our households of strangers .
sterilisations have gone up 48 percent , the cornell institute .
we also observe a trend towards something modest tourism . right ?
one of them is the startling of community and neighborhood , and increasingly emphasis the neighbors &apos; emphasis in support .
we also observe a great domestic movement .
the trend for works is immense .
and then we take the phenomenon of kogi .
and then the question came to me is , am i the only one doing this ?
you could use them .
that &apos;s what i do in my life -- telling stories , novels . and today i want to share with you some stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creature , the mindsets .
our imaginations could shrink . our hearts could be carried , and our humanity could be distorted if we could refuse too long within our cultural cocons .
and that &apos;s where i first encountered what i call the &quot; representative executives . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , i &apos;m not a refugee or exilantin . i &apos;m going to ask why i am doing that , but the commuting between languages makes me reinvent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge issue , because i was prosecuted .
literature needs to take us to the other side .
i could write a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe that will become a happy story , and in my next book , i might write about a good-looking , sweep professor in norway .
that &apos;s how you remix . you take songs already , you cut them into little bits , and you shape that piece around , mix them together again , and you get a new song , but that new song is clearly made out of old ones .
instead , these laws and laws of the world use the rather unhollowed comparison of the ownership .
it &apos;s a 28-page software patent , but i &apos;m going to summarize what it &apos;s covered . ridiculous alarm : the flattering of the telephone by shooting a symbol with its fingers .
our creativity comes from the outside , not from the inside .
and then you say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the guardian newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful is you can probably see this limb there , sort of an unclear bind leg ah , rising out of extremity .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now this led to a understanding of the atomic structure , because it &apos;s getting so pissed that atoms have a single core , with elephons orbiting it .
this picture shows a galaxy , a very world-galaxy , with , you know , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it can ultimately release the profound ideas for us , about our place in the universe , and really the value of our home planet .
this is here . this is at home . this is us .
and with every mouse click and every touch of the screen , we drop like hangs and gretel brotkrums of our personal information all over our way through the digital woods .
when our daughter sat down at the breakfast , i asked her , &quot; is there a lot of value on musical competence on your school ? &quot;
we can &apos;t sit around on this as well .
now , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was debating and talking so much , i decided on my 27th birthday , that i wouldn &apos;t talk for one day only for one day -- one day .
and they don &apos;t talk ... ?
and i explained with the help of a friend who understood my sign language , that i was john francis that i was walking through life that i was not talking , and that this would be the last time someone was going to translate my signature .
well , i took my backpack again .
i started talking again because i had been studying environmental sciences .
but the distinct thing was that i was thinking about every birthday about my silence , but never about my decision to just use my feet .
born and raised , i grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found little jobs against food in exchange .
i was always worried that i was being captured and sent back .
i felt so powerful because i had so much to eat in america , but my father had died of hunger .
but i firmly believe that your gestures of love and caring can also save the life of another joseph and can change thousands of other josephs that still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but it was much stronger than i expected to do hydrogen , and as an industrial tool , it was a heat consultancy .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich , government , contractors .
and then in the following year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe in japan .
so i wonder , what is a permanent building and what a temporary building ?
but this is really needed .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we are born , even in the womb .
so fetuses even learn the certain language spoken in the world that they &apos;re born into .
it creates a mixture of influences that are so individually and peculiar , as the woman himself .
why should malnutrition in the womb lead to peer disease ?
but you can also see ptsd with the other eyes .
this trust in fictive , for any kind of theatrist , is essential .
the audience is going to be hunted in terms of mutation , which is very logical , but not with the consent of what &apos;s happening in front of your eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , it may even bring us to smile .
you may remember it as the aol-time warner-fusion , okay . then the largest deal of all time is announced .
if you &apos;re a high animal at the unesco , and someone says to you , &quot; what do you actually do for the audacity of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad campaign ?
this is actually a strategy , and i &apos;m not arguing that strategy plays a role .
for me , all the music became .
now , when i use my software , the camera will see the infrared dot , and it will register the site of the camerapixel in relation to the project pixels , and you &apos;ve got a whiteboard .
i remember the poor needed something tangible -- food , clothing , shelter -- what they didn &apos;t have .
i actually felt an anniverge of shame &apos;s underground .
now that i heard him speak , i was excited for various reasons .
i was not even asked for a donation , which was my species .
it &apos;s about retelling the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving some of us a way of engaged what their dignity would say , a partnership is not a partnership based on a traditional way of the donation can happen .
it &apos;s a far more meaningful combination , a very strong combination .
right now , profounder is at the very beginning , and it &apos;s compassionate , and it &apos;s very clear to me that it &apos;s just a vehicle , it &apos;s just a tool .
what does the future of humanity look like ?
now i turn to the second big question : are we alone or are there other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions show that we &apos;ve made remarkable progress over the last hundred years .
look at this .
here are pictures of myself .
in fact , the rate doubles every 18 months and every penetrated member of the digerati know that &apos;s the moore &apos;s law .
but what about you ? what &apos;s it going to do with you ?
they sail in their signs of heaven and occasionally , they kidnap people for experiments that their parents wouldn &apos;t agree with .
so we &apos;re interested in things like this .
past generations have not been able to do these experiments at all .
and what i found is that the first technology came out about 2.6 million years ago in the form of stone tools .
we can learn a lot about it in the environment .
and i look carefully enough , and i try to protect my child , because with such a child , you don &apos;t let anyone alone , even a minister .
and secondly , she tells us that she had an exciting gang , but had some adaptations for climbing trees .
so far , our ancestors have come to us about , basically , adult individuals , because the fossils , the baby fossils , were missing .
paleoanthropologist ceresenay alemseged studies the origin of humanity in the vast ethiopia . he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child , and what we can learn about our human being .
and of course , if all of these are supposed to be the rules , of course you need an effective system to test and review and the law , because how we &apos;ve determined , both trust is required to control .
it &apos;s seen as high seas , because the continent was taken by territorial claims .
we have to work locally , but we also have to transfer the whole seafood .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol coletta says , &quot; i would pay to do what i do . &quot;
i think that was a pretty good idea .
to be clear , i &apos;m a journalist , not a technologist , so i want to quickly design a sketch , what the present and the future will look like .
and finally , i think we all have to think about whether we want this to become our reality -- and if what it means for our idea of life and everything that comes after that .
it looks like pinnacle .
the symptoms of the complex are that you have the strong and unchanging opinion of having the right solution no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times and explain how it works .
of course we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher than the americans falling rate , for example .
we &apos;re going to try that . it &apos;s probably all going to go wrong .
immediately . &quot;
taniyama tried it over and over and over , but he could never prove the guess .
i want to argue that our approach is simply not sustainable .
china wants to have done this in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is naturally uncertain .
yes , it &apos;s getting ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to happen soon -- with safety in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome everything that &apos;s coming towards us .
and here they come in .
and what we need to think about is , if you dance in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we could put these debt on our children , but imagine if we could .
everything else is scheduled .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what level of development the cell was .
this shouldn &apos;t be an amazing thing , isn &apos;t it ?
all we get is roomba .
they will be able to focus their listening , maybe increase the sensitivity , or humiliate a number of things that we can &apos;t do .
that &apos;s not 1,000 years in the distance .
we should have this cheap , simple cure opportunity and no one to use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this medicines .
we can &apos;t risk losing the customer &apos;s trust .
he only got 500 , and he could have gotten up to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge top of the placebo pills that they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- the things we all talk about -- is just a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , the internet has been around for more than 5,000 days -- but the web only 5,000 days .
so if we say the machine that we created now is a hb , a human brain , if we look at the rate of growing this , there &apos;s six billion hbs in 30 years .
now it &apos;s not -- if you do a chart and stuff at work , a word document , you &apos;re not part of the web , but you &apos;re going to be part of the machine . you &apos;re going to be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will become the extended sense of machine . &quot; in some sense .
it &apos;s going to be solved on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want to disrupt .
the last point i wanted to talk about is this idea that we will be co-dependent .
third , it &apos;s going to be more ubiquitous , it &apos;s going to fill all of our environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second resurrection of jesus christ had occurred that it was sun myung moon , and that i was considering and prepared for god to become his younger .
this is the dead of jonestown .
and it allows everything . it makes everything be logical .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas about how we organize things .
this is a project we &apos;ve just done in penang for a massive city project that came out of this process , which is the result of a variety of forces that are developing .
and that led directly to another project .
it &apos;s actually a false mindset , because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are contributing to the educational process of young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a court building .
each of them is rotating towards their neighbors .
this is how we have to pay school money .
so we have a big brain , a huge advantage , because we can influence our environment .
my story is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a full brain .
this muscle control is very , very important , because there can be reflexes .
we learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , at some point , we were all like animals and then not . &quot;
these are men and women who can even name 250 stars in the night sky .
of course , the tibetan monks told us that .
intiwatana , the pfosten , hanging on the sun is actually an obelism that reflects light all the time that seems to the sacred apu of machu picchu , the zuckerhutberg , called huayna picchu .
when they pray for the dead , they do these gestures with the hands that they put their thoughts up into the sky in spiders .
here &apos;s the place where the great mother has shaped the spindel into the world that &apos;s climbed up the mountains and created the homeland that they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique facettes of human imagination .
this material that you all know is styropur , but i think it &apos;s more like toxic white stuff .
i fit in there , you fit in there , because in a hundred years , my body can go back without preparation into the earth .
it &apos;s a waste product .
you want to apply it all over the world , and you don &apos;t have to take care of reisspeaku or cotton dishes , because you have many different alternatives .
first of all , they catch atoms in a special bottle .
i started a competition four years ago called &quot; dance your ph.d. &quot;
my country is dedicated with 15 trillion dollars .
and this is -- -- this is even more challenging than all the speakers in front of me and all the ones that come after me .
and she thought about my work of mathematical models that should encourage an understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience doesn &apos;t like head-tail-tails -- for deep , cultural reasons , they think it &apos;s boring -- and they find another pattern much more interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about it in two ways .
if you toss a coin , you get a sequence of head and a number .
back to more secular fishing , because of which you &apos;re dealing with uncertainty .
and only one percent is wrong .
he postulate , &quot; i suspect that after a sudden childhood death row , the likelihood of one another . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but not quite unlikely .
all of the quality control , which has far outcomes to the industrial processing , is carried by statistics .
the smoke melder may have saved hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide .
an intelligent power outlet prevents injury because the stream is always out until a cleverer gets detected . simple .
but , on the other hand , china &apos;s a sick-land . it &apos;s a term from facebook events .
you have facebook , we have sights .
yet , the chinanet can create a very strong force , which has never been in the history of china .
that &apos;s why chinese are looking at this microblogging as a real medium , not just a mere headline .
how a big ted , right ?
so in the last three years , civil movements have really transformed by microblogging governments , made them more and more transparent because they have no access to the data .
more and more chinese see free speech and human rights than their birthright , rather than an imported privilege of imported privilege .
many of you know that that was beethoven &apos;s seventh symphony .
i &apos;m not saying you can &apos;t live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can pretty nerve .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems that his legs had been removed to try and detect the cause of death , so that &apos;s why there was sound in there , and his skull on the sides of it .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i look around , in this tedxamsterdam auditorium , i see an extraordinary audience .
in many countries , that &apos;s a different thing .
at this crucial point in the dutch story , my father was at the bank of the waal flusses nearby nijmegen .
the rate of civil wars and oppression have been down since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their weapons as tools of peace .
peter van uhm : why i took a gun
this program gets a form and then spits 250 dna sequences .
this is a tension rise in tuolumne meadow in the middle of the yosemite .
you can &apos;t let &quot; locker . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in both of them .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical rationale for why technology evolves in exponent ways .
now , the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution basically was a creation of species to produce the next stage , which was the first step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; so we can use good the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent collapse growth in information technology per year .
another big revolution is the communication revolution .
to come back to our exponential growth of computing : 1,000 dollars of computing power is currently about the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and in 2029 , we &apos;re going to reach the full ripe of these trends , and you have to be worthy of how often the screeching of the technology has turned faster and faster if we get to that point .
they can make blessing and twinkling .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the gene pool .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , there &apos;s nothing there .
dopamine seems to be the thing that is connected to pattern administration .
and we then call that schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post that and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought experiment before , they &apos;re a hominid in the african flat land .
september 11 has a conspiracy theory . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own lip bar , and we have a leading product .
i wasn &apos;t as good as he did , but we managed to bring youssou n &apos;dour , sting , tracy chapman and bruce springsten to a world day for amnesty , and that was a great experience .
they kept telling us , &quot; the truth &quot; told us , &quot; and told us .
musician and activist peter gabriel explains his personal motivation to stand with the monitoring group of widow &apos;s rights and shares stories of active civil journalists .
next , we &apos;ve asked ourselves , how do they do this ?
he recognizes the problem and knows about it . the dance is his transition behavior that allows him to reorient .
the beetles climb a lot of rarer on the pill when they have boots than if they don &apos;t wear .
here &apos;s our dispersed experimenter .
let &apos;s play a 50-hers-frequency and see what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
mallory &apos;s argument that it &apos;s fun to fall into these big adventures , isn &apos;t really true with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother is going to go to antarctica next year .
so the whole purpose of the presentation of persuading the capitalists is that you &apos;re an entrepreneur that you &apos;re investing in and you &apos;re going to make a lot of money with it .
and besides having an experience of creating or leading a company or doing something -- it doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there &apos;s no financially supported business where there were no problems .
from there they take them from -- on a solid , arranged path up , right from beginning to end .
if i happen to know somebody who made a device like this .
no , they &apos;re not .
and then you give me a quick business overview .
even if the competition works on old patterns ...
i hope it was all positive , positive , positive , more positive .
if you follow my suggestion , you &apos;re going to have a terrible , very c-like presentation , which is great to vemitn , who you are and to emotionally tackle .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a beetle .
if you imitate something , you might have an effect on it .
and if you have enough of them , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , in the last place than the culture that &apos;s not estimated innovation .
as we think and behave , our behavioral system is broken .
we have a running memes -- to be serious .
but excuse me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the biggest neotie ?
it &apos;s very consoluous .
we think backwards .
by transforming change , change , such as transparency , change , such as self-control , and collaboration , and not autocracy , these things are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way things are always done , the only way we can get rid of it is to get rid of the old deck and find new creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and we can share the ideas of games , we can turn bulgaria into something better .
the magazine for industrial design is , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me on the oven-building , because the oven-structured then was too much about it .
and after i &apos;d done it with a hand movement , they were very -- i was accepted , and i was working there for about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all the stuff .
my kids , davey and henry .
we submitted several magazines , we did our homework , but where we also looked , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture literally came out in seconds after i got the baby in the arms , and i brought it over .
rg : oh .
av : taboo number three : you don &apos;t talk about your miscarriage -- but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has gotten a little better since i participated at the miracle of birth and a family .
but what you find is you find that you lose control in a wonderful way , which we think gives a lot of sense to our lives and which is extremely satisfying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a series of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve all seen these &quot; star treks &quot; with the holodeck consequences .
imagine being heard , large , already deceased piano players today , how they would play personally . john q. walker shows how footage can be analyzed to the exact strikes and pedal movements to then take you back to the computer-controlled wings .
well , since then , we &apos;ve seen a time of extraordinary economic respiration , the longest recovery in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , as well as politicians might always be in the sauce apple , &quot; without attracting the mine , &quot; as anyone expressed , their insecure , they can &apos;t even hide .
now , i didn &apos;t really understand this , until i met this guy , who was then 80-year-old , slightly chaotic man , who was fed by tomato soup and bugs for wholesale .
but interestingly , it also implies a future where society is looking at a couple of pieces of capitalism , which is how you &apos;re incessantly integrating the dna into society by trying to process things and then rebuild those that work and build them .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis today , and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve worked on , about the relationship between the structure of the language that they speak and their tendency to save .
and when i want to talk right , i force chinese to think about it all the time .
well , that &apos;s a phantom theory .
please press this device so hard you can with your dominant hand , so i can measure your tangible .
it &apos;s the current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate across generations .
we put it all the time in english .
but i &apos;m against using them as a hurdle .
but they didn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
at the same time , i was in the field of weather modification , even though i was a ph.d. in aeronautics .
people and bisamrats and giraffes and birds and everything , the red line here goes up . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused more on serious energy problems in the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s take a look at the next video .
the night went around at the party last night , and -- you can see how it just flies around , and you can spy every one you want to .
and he was unhappy about how people practiced the buddhist religion in india at the time .
and he goes back to the village as a broken man .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the stops and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re long . we &apos;re taking the feeling of remembering a mother and extending this to all the living things in this meditation .
and you think about how lovely things are when you &apos;re happy when you &apos;re satisfied .
and of course they are cruel and cruel to others .
although the change in your mindset does something for other creatures , it feels that new quality in you , and it &apos;s already helping you , and it &apos;s serving you as a role model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup with access , is one of the society used tools to maintain public health .
interestingly , complexity is very highly designed .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very simple once you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four generalizations remarks , an example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop you with details , but in the lower right corner , you &apos;ll see an example of what we have for it .
do they have begun to do that ?
and out of this is the need for things that jimmy talked about , which is our new kind of organization , or expressed better : how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will be less and less able to do , but it will only emerge in using use , in collaboration with the users .
take astronomy , for example , which yochai had mentioned .
there will also be excerpts , professional arguments .
so there will be no dispute of two camp , but between these camps , there will be all sorts of interesting positions taken by people .
this costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to dedicate their bread to somebody , and actually a team managed to do it : between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought about was thank him for that .
but the truth is that life is happening right here .
so people called up the news , and they &apos;d leave news like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m dressed like batman to keep my anonymity in anonymity . &quot;
and the one who didn &apos;t do any type of data , so it turned out that she had just moved to a different town , and had taken a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior based on everything from genes from neurotransmitter , dopamine and such , to target analysis .
some of you too have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
this was one of these cases , because she didn &apos;t have violence under her ancestors , but my father did .
they &apos;re similar to each other as you can possibly be .
by the way , i received an email this morning , which is that we &apos;ve now completed the last part of atlas .
and these guys are the weak force that may be the least known .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why nuclear is holding together , essentially , you should have a powerful computer -- why dna has the shape that it has now .
the comparison is that people in this room represent the higgs particles .
but it &apos;s really that , with this theory , the forces of physics seem to unite at the time of the big bang , an absolutely wonderful prediction . the model was not created with the goal that this is happening , but it seems to be done .
they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , and it converts the darkness into light , and it allows civilization to see out of space .
another great insight came from a study by wayne state university in 2010 , the baseball of major league player from the 50s .
in a similar study in germany , researchers using fmri imaging technology to measure brain activity , and after smiling in the face of botox to suppress smiles .
&quot; because the colors you have order , not the european standard , &quot; he answered .
&quot; safer ? why ? were more policemen deployed here ? &quot;
we built the bright recommendations that people , residents of tirana , made them think they had traveled to abroad if they trusted to make their cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe you can and you &apos;ve done it half before . &quot;
all over port-au-prince , entrepreneurs came in and offered loads for mobile phones .
one illustration of the transformative power of technology finds itself in kibera .
by 2015 , there will be three billion smartphones around the world .
in the stores of the environment were pocklips , batteries and bread .
and that flow of time is embedded in everything : in the erosion of a grain of sand , in the knob that flows to rose .
do you read an interview with a writer ?
and also , when i look at the great bear , i remember , as a child , sketching on his head , not slipping from his shoulders , and i feel like this child again .
we &apos;ve seen over and over how creative technology can be , and in our lives and our lives , we can do the solutions , innovations and moments , not shredding the flow of time , but remanufacturing .
my mother was an englishman .
in every single refugee camp , she had to take a soldier , which was my older brother mark , who was nine , and want to take him a child soldier .
and i should do it by myself .
take something you want to have from the suitcase .
and then i ended up in solitary because i didn &apos;t hold my feelings back .
thank you .
so almost all life on earth is deleted about five times .
svante paabo has the answer .
why should that play a role ?
so , theoretically , we can grow any organ out of any cell .
here &apos;s the increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
when the rotors rotate at the same speed , the robot floats .
and you can see how robust is the control .
and he &apos;s doing that while he &apos;s expanding obstacles .
they take their neighbors true .
this is showing that we can double robotic power , triple , quadruple , where we can get them to form teams , as you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where he wants to go .
i can understand that , but there &apos;s so much , and i want to expand your horizon , open up consciousness and change your view of honeybees .
this has been a huge problem for many years , basically since the late &apos; 80s , when the varroa appears that brought a lot of different viruses , bacteria and mushroom diseases with them .
they don &apos;t experience that .
they take the cooks for their dishes , and the honey -- there are live events -- they use the honey on their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die if they bribe , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , so this is really a question : why is this ?
of course , we &apos;ve also , in particular , in the last decade , managed to reverse the world with a dense chain of supermarkets , with a chain of global trade .
and never before have been so many people unaware of this fact .
in fact , not many of you know that our bread was not european invention , of course .
and especially meat consumption in southeast asia and china is high in the grain price of grain .
agrarscience has for most people , and there are not a lot of farmers here , among them , to be bad , to pollute the environment , at large scale , to destroy the environment .
it &apos;s all hanging together .
and so while i &apos;m finished doing my bread -- and i &apos;ve posted it . and i &apos;m trying not to burn my hands .
it also has to be able to keep a long time in the countryside with which the tools are available , to repair materials and knowledge .
you take someone like me , a scientist , analyze and you test and you develop a new technology , and you definitely have the quantitative improvement .
because i hope you will take this from here today , a new connection with nature .
this was in agumbe a couple of days ago .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is last year .
but poolan devi was one of them , and shekhar kapur made a movie about them , bandit queen , that you should see .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this one actually has basic otters as speciality .
this is a representative patient who was then 73 -- he needed a bypass , but decided to do that .
i like this slide because she makes you talk about what really motivates people to change , and what doesn &apos;t .
if you eat a fat meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a semi-truth . americans even eat more fat than ever , and even more coal hydrates . so the percentage is lower , but the actual number higher , so the goal is to reduce both .
one of the atkins centers sponsored studies found that 70 percent of people were clogged , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent had headaches -- that &apos;s not healthy food .
on the other hand , everything that &apos;s intimately affordable is heating .
i hope it won &apos;t hang on .
the movie is based on a short story of f. scott fitzgerald .
two film studios were involved in the project : warner brothers and paramount .
and we had sufficient passion for doing the work and technology .
so we passed ourselves from motion capture .
the number seemed to be infinite .
and this is the data that we get from that , and that will be used for the model .
and this is what the finished picture looked like that was used in the movie .
this was a very , very , very early rehearsal .
and we found this , in the middle of the state of karnataka .
and it has its own phone cell .
the people of kalandar will transcend this cruel , barbaric past that they &apos;ve lived in for their lives .
we were involved -- two bedouin as a driver -- and imagine that length is an ocean from sand , 40 degrees fahrenheit , a water bottle .
i think the camel is the best designed animal in the world . &quot;
and they use them in a similar way that we see our two-eyed way .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another movie .
i &apos;m not sweating until my body temperature transcends 40 degrees c -- enough to breed an egg .
ricky , thank you for inviting .
you start a meeting with a poem . that would be an idea .
but how would you like it if you never knew how you were going to pass the world like a living god , your shoulders in the clouds , or whether you &apos;re sitting down there from the dapete , quite startling with your little plastic face ?
who could sleep quicker that night ?
but you knew that judy garland in your age got 150,000 dollars a movie that jeanne d &apos;arc showed up the french army on the victory and blaise pascal had cleaned his room -- no , i mean he invented the pocket ?
at the end of it , they sat in a tree , and one strips out the hand to the other .
and the human moral feeling is more than that , but if you remove these two columns , you probably wouldn &apos;t be much left .
and also , in elephants , we have the problem that you can &apos;t build construction that would be too hard for an individual elephant .
one component of that is understanding . here &apos;s a standard definition : &quot; the ability to understand and share the emotions of the other . &quot;
so now we study more complex expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test was not good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple task there that you have to do .
a philosopher even wrote to us that it was impossible to have a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely crazier , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot and a lot of power news .
i spent the last decade trying to expose pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing , self-destruction .
and i have to say , god is thank you .
so i stopped , in a way , it was a success .
over the years , the most serious cycling can be created .
a.j. jacobs : how the healthy life almost killed me .
and i think many scientists share this vision .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically valid , and they have been reproduced , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask about the part of the story that &apos;s not being told .
... a priest ?
and finally , another group that believes that the indus people are the ancestors of today in southern india .
to the left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful in deciding to create more data that will then be analytical .
this sign is the most common of the indus script , and only in this text it appears twice .
it turns out that in india it &apos;s been tradition for a long time to name on the basis of star images at any given time of birth .
space , we all know what it looks like .
this wire really carried the phone signals that would make the name of bell famous .
jansky had made the historical discovery that heaven &apos;s body could abandon as much as light waves could abandon radio waves .
actually , all the young people in the city .
somebody sitting in the seat next to you -- this is o.k. in a venue hall , but you would sit on a parking bank , and someone would sit that close to you , then you &apos;d want to want to exchange .
the dalai lama always likes -- he says , when you get into your mind , you get the idea of compassionate , it &apos;s because you realize that you are yourself and your pain and enjoyable to be a small playground for your intelligence .
i mean , take this wonderful thing that chiho showed us , and she hunted us fear with the lava man .
a man in front of a tank turned into a picture that became a symbol of resistance all over the world .
but what could she not have done yet , if she had had the modern communications , in order to create a sense that the wrong thing that was going on , had to do something ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate on a global level and to organize global with the challenges we face now and are the largely of global nature .
in the museum of the children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a 10-year-old boy -- and the museum of the children think of life that were left when the genocide of rwanda had died a million people .
here &apos;s the task : help me build a dynamic , parameterized contact model in 3d .
they can move on in very different suburbs -- they vary in the contact chances , the movement of the surface and the deceased capabilities .
this one was the driving algae .
boy : steel .
we slow down to see the spines in action .
mark cutkosky at stanford , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer who developed a technique called shape deposition manufacturing , where he can claim directly into an artificial foot .
you see almost like aliens , and the secret of what makes them arrow is their hairy toes .
this is where we take off the band-aid .
these filigrant structures allow the spines , the polar and the criteria , to maintain itself in very challenging difficult surfaces .
so over the long , beautiful songs , serving for mating calls , and males as well as being able to find each other and choose a partner .
so when dolphins are less than 20 meters apart , they have to create less than half of the time the whistles are .
when we think about marine reserves for animals like dolphins , we need to be aware of the consequences of our interventions that we thought were quite harmless .
after the masons , the marine bioacoustics have made these systems accessible to see what the scientists could hear .
they just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to find a mate and they &apos;re scattered , imagine what the effects of this might have endangered species to recover .
as spacecraft can be done , and what they found is that with a more seminated propeller design , that noise can be reduced by 90 percent .
they decreased the speed by 50 percent .
we see alien worlds , we see alien solar systems , 300 so long , and they get more and more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you have all the options you have .
we see a continuous rise in the men .
and obviously there &apos;s one that sees a hundred .
with initiatives like the $ 100 laptop , it crawls me on the idea that we &apos;re launching a whole new generation of people into the old maus-windows-button computers .
thank you .
i think none of this is the problem .
but our daily lives are , in an extraordinary state , let &apos;s say , in an exceptional state , let &apos;s say , in a state of exceptional state .
it &apos;s usually one or two a year .
and there they are .
but we &apos;re much more nuanced .
part of the challenge was to try and hide rhythm and space , and not only am i just handed my hands -- juggling is much more hand-oriented -- but to control the rhythm of my body and feet , and control the balls with my feet .
and then they play mad .
ok , because you all don &apos;t understand what a five-ball pattern is , i &apos;ll give you a little clue .
now again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you &apos;ve got somebody up here doing the operative principle all of your life , ok ?
puff -- and then it comes to the quiet . it &apos;s just a little number over time .
working with space and stores in a different way .
and then changing levels .
this year -- if you want to show the slides -- this year we carry the treo with us , a project where we helped handspring to design .
we can call them up on a touchscreens monitor that enables them to give you more information about the clothes while you try them .
rd scott adams : i found that i was on my way to become the leading expert in the workplace design .
and we &apos;re also announcing a new product tonight , and it &apos;s the first time it &apos;s being shown in the public .
now , the farmers can only be harvested in the rainy season , not in the side season .
electrons disappear in some kind of washing , and then there &apos;s only energy , and energy you can &apos;t see .
that &apos;s what he thought what he was for .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . did you know that ?
all right . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what &apos;s the point behind it , heinrich ?
we &apos;ve spent about four years on this .
when google digitizes a book , they bring it into a very beautiful format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the &apos; 40s , everybody got excited .
but imagine that it &apos;s not going to be interested in .
but also , a lot of the way on the right that seems to have benefited from propaganda .
if you come to the toe , it means &quot; argh &quot; with one a.
if i made this pink sound run longer than a few minutes , they would literally stop listening .
a lot of people escape to headphones , but they turn these big , public spaces like this , shared claims , into millions of little personal sound bubbles .
you can do it in a beautiful place , like in a lake .
and finally , an acronym .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you for being here . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and so they went away .
because they weren &apos;t on our way out there , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange that was going between me and crowd , an exchange that was fair to us , but they seemed alien .
well , i &apos;m going to tell you , in the world change business , there &apos;s a lot of competition last year , because the arab spring is still spreading out , the eurozone is collapsed ... what &apos;s going on ?
in fact , this photograph was glued up in a police station , and on the ground you see the personalities of the people who have been tracked by the police .
the kids just take pictures in a class , the teacher receives them , they plot them on the school walls .
in today &apos;s talk , it &apos;s about the brain and , juhu , somewhere out there &apos;s a brain fan .
this is something that we can work on in our lifetimes , and i believed i could make a difference , and so i tried to get out of the computer business , get into the brain business .
but sometimes science has some other characteristics that really make you really interesting .
what does this bring us more data ?
there &apos;s something that we think it &apos;s obvious , but it &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t think of the alligator as very intelligent , not in a human kind .
in humans , we &apos;ve developed the frontal part of the neocortexes with the name of the anterior part of the neocortex , and nature &apos;s done this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re looking there and saying , &quot; what am i seeing now ?
not like a computer memory . not in the slightest of a computer memory .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need some police , we need a military , but only for defense .
you can see it on their script . &quot;
she was traveling because she was in the elections outside the country at the time .
this is rigoberta menchu .
and then , when she closed the door , oma said , &quot; no , no , no .
you wash like this : by hand .
this group uses three , everyone needs one .
it &apos;s real .
it &apos;s been able to learn english and to learn this as a foreign language .
the computer is already , and it &apos;s one in three participants .
if yes , you think differently than the u.s. employers who were actually part of our experimentes , because that &apos;s what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but there was a delay between the captioning of how to deal with the data , and really the beginning of the questionnaire .
the price for that is the displacement from paradise .
and they were moving , and they were writing to each other , and they were putting their arms up and wandering .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then they make personal coach , the cialis like pepper minds , against bad breath , clogging into it .
i don &apos;t feel comfortable with emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is mindset -- the ability to peer into other people &apos;s minds and figure out what to offer them .
they have epistemological humility .
that &apos;s what the unconscious mind is .
we found them between railroads , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey start ?
and it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : to assemble the process of dictionaries .
well , first of all , i blame the queen because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries need to be different .
the bad words -- you see , when someone thinks in a place , and then they don &apos;t find it on the map , they think , &quot; this card sucks ! &quot;
they &apos;re thinking , &quot; ok , if we consider that words are tools that we use to look at our thoughts , how do you know that helicopters are better than hammer ?
the oed has 33 different numbered definitions for &quot; set . &quot;
and then there &apos;s this mike oates . mike oates live in the u.k.
i said , &quot; the dictionary all the time , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary said . &quot;
so , let me take a chair .
and , to make a long story short , i ended up here .
and so , piece for piece , during those three days , you start to think about this : why do i hear all this meaningless stuff ?
they may be from a ted speaker , and we can run the conversation during the year and come back next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers haven &apos;t implemented the tegrant technology into their cheap gps chips , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start to do with such a precise orientation that actually fold on the palm of the palm .
and it was uncertain that it was already ventilated , and technically not able to find the channel .
instead of disturbing the gps signals , you fake them .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves pors &amp; amp ; rao and we live and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of an inverted person .
we debate about the thesis of what the world needs now is nuclear energy -- right or wrong ?
and so far , there are only three main sources for this -- coal and gas , hydrogen force , which is almost everywhere -- and nuclear energy .
we got rid of the russian warheads by being transformed into electricity .
co2e emissions are equivalent emissions of all greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and have been converted to co2 .
now if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons is related to the prevalence of nuclear power , for example , we know that india and pakistan have evolved nuclear weapons by copying nuclear energy facilities .
for wind , the area is much larger , but the area is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need to have the support of both parties -- just one or two voices required to get global warming in the senate , and that room can help it .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewables .
i was worried about the 10,000 years old .
thank you .
that was -- my motivation was arrested by apollo .
for the first time , we have enough richness in the hands of some less people , and the available technology that will allow us to explore space .
26 groups from seven countries were part of the competition , each between one and 25 million dollars .
orbital flights -- we can get them to the space station .
and the propulsion for the sponsors is the sum of known acknowledging and the social long-term winning .
would they surprise us , fascinate us ?
that means that surfaces can cut themselves . they can become incredibly small .
one challenge was , how can we express this new algorithmic order in a column ?
what i didn &apos;t know at the time , because we &apos;d only seen the outside side , was that the surfaces continued to fold within the column , and that was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the cell division , michael hansmeyer algorithms , who create incredible intriguing forms of millions of surfaces , and no human being could design them by hand , but you can build them , and they could revolutionize our understanding of architecture .
so , look at this picture here -- a lot of shapes are dancing here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see the chip actually mimics the breathing movement .
it &apos;s a very young nation run by young people .
and i think a lot of people in this room , many of them are in the same position i do .
so i believe that women are going to lead in our society , because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations to maintain our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that more and more people have been using resources like youtube and social networks to express their stories , to show their photos and to tell their very own stories with their own voices .
at the same time , we invite them to come and explore our part of the world .
so i was embedded more or less than &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i make these ants a few apartments , put them in there . &quot;
this was called &quot; huf house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back the next day .
and it went ...
my work , roughly estimated , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; you can &apos;t always look forward .
and i &apos;ve made it around , and i &apos;ve shaped it out of the truck .
so i crushed the needle .
it &apos;s a very modest work , but the best things come in little packets .
they expect their employees to do what they &apos;ve asked them to do if they &apos;ve performed the task , they can do extra things .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , this absolute ball of consciousness , consciousness , an absolute center of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity .
my thylacine body flew in one direction , my undenied wheel in the other .
i imagined all the walks that i probably wouldn &apos;t do with you , the art projects that i might not have defeated to you , the friends that i wouldn &apos;t see , the bridges that i could not walk with you .
because then you don &apos;t need to have the safe knowledge session .
and if you approach them backwards , against the wind , you can just tip them around , and it makes plums in the shock . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 percent survival .
as i became more and more unhuman -- and at this point in my life , i was probably 14 pounds easier than i am now .
and no one embodies this modern mannearity in my mind more than david black .
running upright , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s the president of the international union for lifespan , which is the least euphemistic name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born for three and a half months , and it was really a fantastic survivor of him .
so as soon as i tried to approach the piano , i was thrown away in a strong way .
and at the end of it , you were so fast that things like the bumblebee flight weren &apos;t a problem , weren &apos;t you ?
do you want to hear me play ?
dp : &quot; tiger rag . &quot;
i don &apos;t get that .
they &apos;re struggling to develop their own way of living in this forest , in a world that &apos;s even clean , a world that &apos;s not contaminated yet in a world that &apos;s not contaminated .
we now know that they are capable of doing things that have held research for absolutely impossible than i started .
the long supportive connection to the mother that &apos;s developed during that long childhood , and that can stay to the siblings , can stay for all of life , and that can be up to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge logging camps in the forest need now meat , and so the pygmies that hunted in the congo and lived in their wonderful lifestyle for so many hundreds of years .
yesterday , somebody said that .
we have now in every state , and the problems in florida are others in new york .
come on for free , and smash me down here ?
out there with politicians ?
what we want to do in the lab is pretty much the same , but with a few dozen of different kinds of molecules -- such a drastic decrease of complexity , but still trying to make a living thing .
in fact , it &apos;s very vital . once it &apos;s forming , it doesn &apos;t really do something .
now , where you &apos;re all pundits for protocells , we &apos;re going to play a game with these protocells .
so again , we see the self-order of these bodies of oil droplet that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blobs in there represent these black mud mud -- this facet-rich , very complex , organic black slime .
in his lab , martin hanzcyz makes &quot; protocells , &quot; experimental stickse of chemicals that behave like living cells . his work shows how life on earth could have come first -- and perhaps elsewhere .
this is a tadpole walkie to take your tadpole for a walk in the evening .
what is that -- how did you know that ? they took it .
but if we did that with each -- every hydrant , we could redefine the emergency case .
in fact , the mud that is attached to other people in their pretty pink lungs , and it &apos;s associated with it .
the birds could jump from one to another .
you can download the news from him today . you can talk to him .
but holding this flock is going to require a large tribute to our planet .
next , we isolate skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture carrier .
we &apos;ve been working on cell structures for thousands of years , with products like wine , beer and joghurt .
it &apos;s true that if we make uberall around the world our research , we see that there &apos;s almost a universal aspiration of people to own a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen first .
this is a huge mobility of generating mobil energy .
if we can see this kind of future , you can see other people as well .
you had to survive .
and we made sure that we were divided to our school district to maintain funding and support .
because why should our students go so far from where they live ?
it became a book , then to a demonstration .
there was léila &apos;s an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here on the west coast , they destroyed their forest .
but in this picture , you can see how we started building the educational center that soon became a big global environment in brazil .
when i was in my time to start my main study , i was studying the newly topic of the landscape ecology .
if you zoom in the south of manhattan , you &apos;ll see the proportion of new york city as it used to be , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are located by the winterwinds of protected places .
or the moore turtle , which would fire , take insects and sonnite places .
maybe there was a whale time-line living there .
there &apos;s so much force to unite science and visualization that arisen pictures of this . it &apos;s like both sides of the mirror .
and we currently have a really dramatically non-sustainable level of it in our society .
so i don &apos;t have to go into that .
you leave it untouched , which is , of course , to remain .
this is a biomorphes building .
one example we all know is that of the cell phones . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course , in a very artistic and indirect way .
but it &apos;s everywhere , and these tools are parts of it that help us to do it .
seriously -- clap it quietly -- that &apos;s great .
alex steffen : a sustainable future
you might think that this could be a big problem for a law , but congress doesn &apos;t seem to be very disturbing about it .
but if you create and sell lots of qualitatively high-quality copies , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things that we share we &apos;ve made of things that we &apos;ve found and create every single option in this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very elitist , confused , expensive training in india , and that &apos;s almost broken me .
and i thought , i started a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional man is somebody with a combination of competence , confidence and persuasion .
when i said that , they said , &quot; show us what can you do . what do you do ?
all the electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , civil right , how to measure your country , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested to what you should do if an animal is sick .
when it comes to friction , it diminishes the attendance to the schools , it comes between teachers and parents , so the dolls can call the teachers and the parents in front of the village and say , &quot; give you the hands .
you use sign language .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a success story .
and our engineers create one of the largest , dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of information exploration .
you can see here the electron flow along the lines of electricity that we &apos;ve created as an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data from these two groups of people , data on how happy they are .
&quot; i am so much better , financially , emotionally , mentally and so much better in almost any other way . &quot; i don &apos;t regret a minute .
he didn &apos;t loan him the money , and of course , ray croc had six months later the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re in the experiment i &apos;m going to be used to tell you about , prints of monets &apos;s images .
we collected our materials , went out of the room and waiting for half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they scaled two pictures , and now they had two beautiful 8x10 gorgeous trains for them to make significant things , and we said , &quot; which of them would you abandon ? &quot;
we take a whole new group of naives harvard students and we say , &quot; you know , we &apos;re going to give a photo class , and we can do it in two different ways .
night footage that go through the big car and the milky way are beautiful .
voices : it flies into the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition does not come from the clouds of avalon , but it goes back into a time before we drawing stories on papyrus or piktograms on fire cave walls .
the kind of food , yeah .
the vested with the walled roof , you know .
and so we let my father sleep for my afternoon , because i knew he &apos;d kill me if i &apos;d drive them alone , so we &apos;d get on the car .
&quot; and did this guy have about a blue uniform , and put a look on the face ? &quot;
do i really want to go there ? because if i don &apos;t have ariadnes fades to announce me -- enough metaphors for their taste ? -- it might never be that i &apos;ll ever come back .
you see ? we &apos;re a secret gap with a secret handicap .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i agree for the little old lady , don &apos;t blow me up . &quot;
it &apos;s up from the car . &quot;
i &apos;m really scared .
so what is the social outcome of this ?
where can i go today and cry with ?
and if we have it , we will decide how many kilometers we &apos;re going to drive in what travel mode , where we live and work .
smart terminals communicate in the ward , and you can see exactly where your bus is going , and when it comes out , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
i want us to look at the wireless mesh interstate system , and i challenge that this network is supposed to be accessible with open standards for everyone .
and they came up here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who have been touching mental illness with a mental illness , you know what a challenge this can be .
i said i wanted to tell you the amazing story , i wanted to share with you the three a &apos;s of fantastic , and i wanted to leave you with one final thought .
because they were all once three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier is just an authentic person , and that &apos;s what the authenticity is about .
i ate oliven with torch . &quot;
you can sleep in clean stores .
j it &apos;s so many that vision has become problematic .
i thought it was odd to speculate about it as if it was a competition , it was such a fresher wound .
it was mainly a white , rich entrepreneur group , who was not representative for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a half-million-dollar project .
people down at the bottom of two things -- they were amazed by the destruction , but there was also a sense of faith about the heroics of the new yorker that i found very moving .
because given the four platforms along the site -- where the improved version of a family platform is -- we knew it had to be moving to change conditions and change definition of ground zero .
we have the opportunity to think about cities .
dr : it was an honor to me .
and i know that children suffer concussions every year .
if -- god forbid -- any of us sitting here and a concussion , most of us would ever be able to produce completely in a period of hours to a couple of weeks .
you have to know the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
and as it turns out , tom saw a helmet for 20 dollars was a good opportunity to keep a $ 100,000 college education .
that &apos;s not true , but it happened to tony blair during the davos forum in 2005 , when his doodles , of course , were discovered , &quot; and he was described like this .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that happens in predictable sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all the countries are compelled to offer patents for pharmaceuticals that have been around at least 20 years .
it depends on the willingness of the pharmaceutical companies to admit their patents and make them available to others .
in orlando , the same kind of stadium , open-air stadium , and people were sitting in the prall sun , in the afternoon , at very high humidity , and they didn &apos;t feel comfortable .
you can look at everything you can to make for your well-being .
it provides all of these services , instructions , tickets buchen and so little things that you do online for a moment , but for people that he &apos;s just connecting to the digital world .
the question was , how do you make this teacher ?
let &apos;s see what he &apos;s doing here .
and the husband of the daughter , he was also sick with the creation of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
now , headlines have a lot of heat in our studies .
well , if we feel emotions , we show them .
and you might get the impression that the unhappy people are taking a different structural position within the network .
that &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
it &apos;s both carbon , and yet one of the two carbon atoms in it , which is arranged in a particular way , on the left , and you get graphite which is soft and dark .
in order to relativity something , let me zoom out for a moment .
and finally , getting older is not easy .
in the same circumstances , older men constitute their cognitive resources , like mindlessness and memory , are more on positive information than on negative information .
we cost life out .
they made me wish , &quot; tonight , i &apos;m going to perform this moonwalk for this girl on this bar mitzvah . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s like i say , quite frankly , often i don &apos;t know what happens when i dance .
they called me brother and uncle and invited me over five years , over time , to recharge me .
1868 : the second treaty of fort laramie guaranteed clearly the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the rights of the lakota to the sacred black hills .
the treaty of fort laramie demanded that at least three quarters of the tribe would have to sign land .
they were tired of treaties .
the teacher fluctuation is eight times the size of the american average .
so what &apos;s left us ?
and today ? child mortality has declined from 24 percent of today , 6.5 percent .
you either get it as a pill or a syringe , you have to take it every day to regulate the blood sugar mirror .
if we , like here , have to do with people ...
but basically , there &apos;s a lot of sense .
it says , are you smarter than a fifth grader ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is that this car looks safe .
now you &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depends on it , of course , i would use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect this with a scientific method .
this is something other than actually making an effective ad campaign .
which is nothing new .
the lights become dark .
we make them for our customers .
we have left them lying in the sun .
now , logic -- logic looking logic , you can now look at , from this position to which you can get -- without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to grasp now . now , every time ... another person -- not always the same answer .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some underground techniques .
here , i have to watch from the beginning , so i can follow my maps during the forecast -- oh , we should have started together -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : excuse me ?
which card should i use ? queen or five ?
lg : but you see the hand .
moment , wait a moment , please take any card .
another color . lg : karo , perfect .
compassion .
diamonds ass , yeah ? zoe : yeah .
here -- are all the cards covering -- here -- are all the cards distributed to me ? right ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly five seconds .
some of you seem to know this child .
after i &apos;d been back , i &apos;d made my whole company a one-buttock company . &quot;
if you didn &apos;t have a musical hearing , it wouldn &apos;t turn off gears in the car .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening here .
i always say to my students , &quot; if you have a fallacy , every time you have an eyebrow , everyone recognizes it . &quot;
imagine the person , and at the same time they &apos;re going to follow the whole way to e and they &apos;re going to hear everything that chopin had to say .
i had an amazing experience . i &apos;ve been 45 , i &apos;ve been a conductor for 20 years , and i &apos;ve had suddenly a realization .
she came to auschwitz when she was 15 years old , and her brother was eight , her parents lost her .
so ladies and gentlemen from the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for 21st century tasks , this mechanistic , reward and punishment approach doesn &apos;t work -- often not work and often does harm .
think about your own work .
the standard of living is lower .
these are the tiles of a whole new operating system for our businesses .
this one day has intense autonomy led to a whole series of software errors that might have never existed .
do it because you like to do it .
the aluminum is used because of its light weight .
in a series of 55 bullets , they shrink , proportional , every sphere , and their absence proportions to this small earth .
and the blue side , the opposite side , shows in the other direction .
this has evolved in lots of diarrhea over the years .
the standard picture on the object would probably be a high-resolved picture of the earth .
but it always leaves those 10 percent or more , which are most disadvantaged or successes .
23,000 dollars , and when you go to famine , you have 84,000 dollars .
non-profit organizations have to withstand , courageous , big , challenged to try and find new donations for fear that failure is drawn by the dirt .
so what should you do ?
the overhead now went .
dan pallotta : our mindset of charity is underlying
and then there was the lateral listeners , yes , who have contributed to the music part .
people who have done these stradivaris , the amatis , all these beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s just about execution of music , as it is written , not about interpretation . &quot;
that &apos;s great . and what about the eyes ?
that &apos;s what it does .
you know , the authority is available when it &apos;s needed . that &apos;s very important .
so kleiber is about the process .
as a cultural community , we tell ourselves a lot of stories about the future and what kind of steps we could do from here .
there are 98 rich nations worldwide .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s not really seductive .
and it &apos;s a process that really makes you joy .
they cultivate whether to push it forward .
and the advice that said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have transition stroud , we would have to invent this entire communal infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced , and to some extent the games that they &apos;re playing to hide this so much , so that you can &apos;t see what the really obvious challenges are .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states that are not faced with this big challenge .
and even if you &apos;ve just come out like this , you could actually transfere money there .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a remind when i went to godfried schlaug , and that is , i was at a divorce in my life , and i was trying to decide between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar-powered clocks , a young lady i knew that sex was so good because of the five senses .
and the statement is , good sex affects all five senses in an extreme level .
of course , the five senses are not the only thing that life makes interesting .
we &apos;re all born as an artist .
if you have a conversation like this , the child has to come up with the next answer to get this responsibility of what it started .
but their parents tell them , &quot; it &apos;s all washed away from the waves . &quot;
but kids usually do art for fun . it &apos;s games .
but you rarely find a teacher like that .
in karaoke-bars , there are always people singing &quot; she &apos;s gone , &quot; or &quot; hotel california &quot; while imitating guitar riffs .
in that minute , we can turn off the tv set , get out of the internet , get up and start doing something .
the students fall into some sort of trance .
he said it was his profile . &quot; and what are you ? &quot; i said . &quot; actor , &quot; he said .
let &apos;s start by how i got to that point .
there will be stronger storms and bigger floods .
if you do , there will be warming in the future .
but the delay is exactly the expectations .
the economic effects are almost unthinkable .
a large part of the species will be threatened by extinction .
now if a car accident happens , it &apos;s crucial that we &apos;re not just going to save the stuntman , we &apos;re also making the crew .
it was used for something like trampoline , once upon a time , that was all you had .
but today we use a nitrogen print cannon .
it &apos;s not more , it &apos;s a hip castle .
in 1960 , joseph kittenger from united states air force did something very incredible .
one of the difficulties in that altitude , if you go to 10,000 meters -- that &apos;s great , right ? if you go to 10,000 feet , you can really only use oxygen .
they made a puppet after him , that &apos;s what he looked like .
we expect and others that maybe the faa or the caa , or the caa , you have to put somebody in a suit that &apos;s not inflated , who &apos;s connected to the plane . &quot;
there were three conductive motives -- right ? -- that attracted through the conference that &apos;s important for what i want to talk about .
and the girl said , &quot; you know it . &quot;
the problem is to remain an artist as you grow up , and i &apos;m convinced now that we &apos;re not going to grow into creativity , we &apos;re going to grow out of it , or we &apos;re teaching many more .
all over the world .
the whole system was invented -- all over the world there were no public education systems before the 19th century .
the brain is not divided into areas .
they did ballet , they did steppdance and jazz , they danced modern and contemporary dances .
the festival is going on very well . with a poignant press you were going to die for .
let &apos;s just say value for money .
dubai , for me , is like a hand that wants to get each supportive of the things going .
before i go back to the middle east , i just want to refer to as a review with one of the biggest sheiks in the middle east .
it &apos;s also the pathology .
all right . they are disturbances of behavior , and they are disorders of the mind .
we don &apos;t have all the facts . we don &apos;t even know what the tools are going to be , or what we need to seek in the individual case , to be able to get there before the other way shows .
how are you going to extend it ? &quot;
the three are all the same , although they &apos;re all the same in a variety of context , one is magical , and the other two of them i like these books because they have something very special in them .
the kids taught them .
they were very friendly .
we also believe that content is more important .
i was changed by my children .
howard does this experiment , and when he gets the data , he draws a curve , and suddenly he recognizes that there &apos;s no beautiful beam curve .
this was his marine rettich . he was obsessed with it .
howard doesn &apos;t believe that there are these at all .
that &apos;s what people always say when you ask them how they want their coffee .
a mustard with more elegance and culture and meaning .
that &apos;s it . and why did we like that ?
he was dipped a couple of times , and he spent most of his career in lower league , and then ended in management . he became the general manager of the oakland a &apos;s general .
we all know what happened when millions of women went into decades of hormone therapy for symptoms until we found a huge study based on the national health agencies .
thank you .
but dad &apos;s chief rak creepy , and he didn &apos;t want us to do that .
but there &apos;s also a gray zone in between .
these are four really different ways of seeing the world . i named them .
what &apos;s interesting is , as soon as you print it -- and -- by the way -- this is from 1450 -- all the artifacts of modern comics : rectangular scriptures of simple line drawings without treasure and a lesion left to the right .
and that &apos;s what i proposed : we might be able to do comics on an infinite canvas : on the x- and on the y-axis and in staircase form .
this is by daniel merlin goodbrey in the u.k.
maybe all of you have been clear this for a long time , but for me , so often i encountered this very difficult challenge every day , i had never seen this inherent challenge that was so crystally .
this is frankly and upright , and the reason fey &apos;s depiction was such a sustainable impression .
if you think your baby is gay or lesbian , you should be able to release it to the adoption .
perrys &apos;s political solution was to demand the citizens of texas , to pray for rain .
this is a song called &quot; farther than the sun . &quot;
i want to start a little bit differently tonight , because i want to ask you to step out of mainland and jump to the open ocean for a moment .
they showed up soon after the disappear of dinosaurs , 65 million years ago , when whales still had legs , and they created a split group of rebellitic fish , they allow me to share this poetic narrative .
and how do you do that ?
the california seelowe takes the molas , when it comes to the bay , it rips the fins , turns them into a kind of fresh , and then throws them around .
i &apos;ll just show you our last data set .
and what was most exciting was that all of their love and their interest in the oceans .
as you can see here , this is a one-and-a-half diameter of platine .
you don &apos;t hear something like this every day .
ah- hah .
most of the time in australia , it &apos;s the aboriginal that are in jail .
she told him , and he commissioned the first enterprise in what we now call the steering dance .
because no one can do a defense .
so why don &apos;t we see anything to do this problem in everyday life ?
goodbye mahatma gandhi .
could i get my last track ?
never , that &apos;s impossible ! no , no , no ! that &apos;s not possible . &quot;
you could deal the whole thing with the addition .
from neumann , a logic and a mathematician brought it all together by the army , and then they needed a space to build it .
the input and output first worked by the remote tape .
&quot; aha ! &quot; after all , they found that it was a programming problem .
i know when i have to be beaten . &quot;
he &apos;d run the machine all night , and if someone remembers stephen wolfram , who invented the whole thing again .
now we &apos;re sitting here 50 years later -- it &apos;s sort of like a legal animation .
sadly , in the next 18 minutes i &apos;m talking about here , four americans who are still alive now are dying . because of their diet .
this is a global problem .
mourn city .
and he &apos;s full of it . he &apos;s tired of having to enrich his family and his community .
they want -- they want to control themselves .
you know that for a long , long time , it has remained in that close understanding .
we don &apos;t teach our children .
and most of the kids get them .
all right , supermarkets .
if you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
a lot of wonderful things are going on throughout america , if we just look back now .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a refined group of politically motivated hackers who got 2011 .
the web connects everything , it &apos;s going to become very soon a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous uses its hacking information but not for financial profits .
he explained how he went on tour in new york in 2003 and 2004 , he took 10,000 dollars from the atm machine here , 30,000 dollars from the atm machine using cloned credit cards .
he was born in southern germany to a stable and respective family , his obsession with play with youth led him to hacking .
and most of them , except for script and cha0 , didn &apos;t show real social skills in the outside world -- just on the net .
i think there are several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into detail , but some of the things that i &apos;m talking about .
but they &apos;re all determined by the market , and what drives the market is primarily -- number one is the great demographic surround forcing .
we also found a lot of examples of dead big boxes that have been transformed into all sorts of social institutions , lots of schools , lots of churches , lots of libraries , like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets to be expanded by the novelty of mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it &apos;s helped to make sure that eight out of 13 regional malls have come out in denial plans to be retrofitted .
the bach was covered by the parking space .
their inhabitants are different than anticipal , but they &apos;re less diverse than cities .
&quot; look at his vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole daytime . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t start there , it started a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about a gender which is a fundamental resource on the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a body world , and the species really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning in us to hang our bodies on our heads -- that this separation has created a division that often separated the conclusion of it .
i want to tell you this little story about my own beginnings , because it &apos;s very much related to happiness and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s on my birth state of south carolina , which is not much smaller than the hungarn today , and used to be dreamed of a future as independent land .
now , maybe he was too rubbish , because he stayed where he was , for a long time after the end of the nazis , and even after the census and deportions started in budapest .
and he received the same answer : &quot; bring me the best workers that you can find , and if you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;ll hire them . &quot;
and also clearly it tells us , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was so beautiful .
&quot; aha ! &quot; dr. robicsek said , &quot; i left the movie all by myself . &quot;
as i said , it floods too much .
and you can imagine them right .
you know what they &apos;re looking for .
but we take care of the hardest cases , and we restore the other people for the next day .
so we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother walked along , during the time of the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not going to go anymore , it &apos;s pushing for as long as you keep making it .
what i &apos;m trying to do with this -- i hope to illustrate these points .
and what i &apos;d like to point out later in the presentation , 50 percent of the united states is below the ocean .
it &apos;s rabenblack there , because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is 3.2,000 miles . the rift valley is nine miles .
and so we drove along the mountain range in an area next to the galapagosreef , and we found the missing heat there .
so i began to develop a new video communication technology , with a robotic system that replaces me , and i don &apos;t have to go into my vehicle .
we find the review of conservation .
and i looked at her yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would leave a kid with no driver &apos;s control over my tax system .
in some parts of the world , for example in south africa , education is very difficult to have .
when we saw the effect of the officer , andrew and i decided that we had to extend it to provide as many people as possible to offer the best education .
what was the particular thing about these classes ?
the video is interrupted every few minutes , and the student will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues in mind that multiple choice is not that bad .
in terms of certain courses , you can wonder which are the number one misunderstandings and how to help the students fix them .
we even see the beginning of either by a personalized study plan or personalized feedback we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was , which means infinity when i was a child .
and of course , in our society , it &apos;s mostly about arguing the reality of others .
i have my doubt about the values of newton science , like rationality , which is expected to be rational in a word .
so you can understand my surprise when i got to read in the new yorker , that alan greenspan , head of federal reserve , asks ayn rand was his insultment mentor .
i think you can make fun of those who don &apos;t have them , they don &apos;t have them . because of that reason , i don &apos;t have any jokes about kenneth lay and his charming fau .
i already miss those old times of the telemarketings , i &apos;ll tell you .
he said i &apos;d have to give him more respect , because it can take too 18 years to become a really good pantomime .
huh ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear them . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid this active somebody doesn &apos;t like us .
i once wondered about moshe safdas &apos;s thoughts about beauty that she told us yesterday , because hyde in his book says that trickster sometimes can highlight beauty .
george w. bush : what the defense of our security also costs , and also , what costs the defense of our freedom , we have to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer in the world would have come up with the idea -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he always doubled that an experiment with a particle accelerator could go out and do a chain response that destroys the world .
we have to go through biotechnology as the same caution as nuclear power stations .
and of course , we don &apos;t want to see one .
what can we do about that ?
and now comes the worst .
we use a lot of money to make sure that we &apos;re not going to die in an aircraft collapse , but we &apos;re spending almost nothing for it , and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get caught on the wrong foot again .
i hope it will .
this is very , very important , because this is the system , the smudder , coming out of life on the planet , and it &apos;s time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve only known about it recently .
and that &apos;s what brings the system , a number of places in the southern hemisphere , represented in these circles .
anyone who comes to the later just reaches on the database and can recall the information that &apos;s needed for everything that &apos;s happened .
we &apos;re about to ripe the wave , the technological possibilities .
in an earthquake , there are large amounts of these new microbes that we &apos;ve never seen before , out of the sea floor .
oceanograph john delaney creates a network of high-resolution cameras and sensors that make our oceans to the global , interactive lab -- and trigger a data explosion across the world of deep .
so i believe that optimism is driving architecture forward .
so again , radically versus conservative .
the unexplained to comprehensive , you know , too often you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desire is complex .
you know it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i prefer to play something completely unknown , and even with mistakes , instead of repeating the same continuity so that it &apos;s hollocked out of its significance .
risks of rooms that have never been so faithful , as they should be in a groundbreaking city .
there are the emotions of the victims .
daniel libeskind builds on very big ideas . he calls here 17 terms , who are underlying his vision of architecture -- roh , wagged , emotional concrete , radically -- and inspiration for every bold creative pursuit .
it also has the lowest air value of all the cars that size .
record something like this , or will there just be a few main distances ?
em : it just has to . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital , solarcity will install the collectors on the roof and then compute the house , or business owner , a monthly leasing rate , which is lower than the electricity bill .
we have almost failed , but we &apos;ve got to get over it in 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet .
how on earth could a person be so innovative ?
look at this .
boy , if you eat our livestock , and you see a cheetah eating one of our goats , he &apos;s very nervous . just go for him .
we were suffering from hunger .
our tradition looks like this : in every himba-village , there &apos;s a sacred fire .
so far , we &apos;ve been able to support the world wildlife fund to rebuild the very small programs with national scores .
also , very important -- we invest the money in education on aids and hiv .
allowance -- over and over again , an argument among many of the world of marine preservation -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we &apos;re hiding this prize behind huge winning .
dan barber and alice waters are passionate about the culinary revolution for ecological food .
circuit , sells , oysters , oysters , vusher , bunk , saicking -- these are the known species .
it &apos;s like a bucket of protein .
science looks at the world through the mind , quantitatively , things that can be measured and described , but it gives a framework for knowledge and knowledge .
from the plan of a couple of cameras , after three weeks , a plan was developed with 25 time-lapse cameras .
that &apos;s the natural cycle .
it wouldn &apos;t usually be a constant photographer to sundle a photo like this , right ? but sometimes it has to be to show the dimensions .
here &apos;s how the glacier pulls back .
this has seen several cameras .
could india become the origin of or a global center for innovation , just like it has become a global center for baccoffice-service and software development ?
when we asked people in conversations with these innovations centers about what they were working on , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t become a professor unless you were a student .
the best hospitals that doctors were going to go to cancer treatments , even in births , brain strokes , heart disease , artificial hip wrist , emergencies at 4 o &apos;clock in the morning .
it works a little bit like -- this is a recent google search question for four o &apos;clock in the morning .
i said , i know a coded message when i see one .
everyone in our society comes in touch with cancer -- if not personal , then through a beloved person , a family member , a colleague , a friend .
in this space tube , the genetic material , the chromosomes , is within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve applied tumor treating fields in the lab for over 20 different types of cancer , and we see this effect in all of them .
he got the standard treatments .
but what we can see is that the 6th month of the tumor has reacted , and it starts melting away .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new workplace , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and they harvest rainwater from the roof , and there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , soon it looks like this .
there &apos;s a stream somewhere , or there &apos;s a rivers going through this scene .
it &apos;s called &quot; kand . &quot; in english , we have surface water and groundwater .
and they have to go even further down .
these are the beautiful stairs that we just saw on one of the images .
and hiv-infection rates are 27 percent down : 600,000 fewer people a year get hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent from india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in textiles that get people out of agriculture and get them to go towards industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries on the right , you see the per capita gdp , and basically every country with a per capita gdp , we say , less than 5,000 dollars , a corrupt range of say three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india didn &apos;t grow that right .
buy african products .
but i think a lot bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should not drop ipods and bomb bombs -- i mean , there would be a great title for thomas friedman &apos;s new book .
and then 500 people prayed and four of them were selected to go to the side of the facility , and so they had to go and talk to them , and then to blogging about it .
so now , involving citizens in planning by 2020 will not necessarily change anything about it , because it &apos;s still the dictators that are controlling the agenda .
evgeny morozov : does the internet suffer &apos;s worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was hanging around with us younger guys .
because for me , who grew up in that time and lived in this man kisten-related relationship , the question was , &quot; do you want ? &quot; either sex or drugs -- and we didn &apos;t take drugs .
i was like paralyzed , people .
as indians , and now politicians and government minister , i &apos;m pretty much about the rummula that affects our country , all that &apos;s just about india as a new world leader , even the new superpower .
in other words , all kinds of communication devices tell us stories about countries , regardless of whether they want the people to come to the daylight or not .
but because the flash in our country at the time was pretty slow , it took about half an hour to get a call done .
it cannot understand dialogues .
this can have unintended consequences sometimes . ok .
and those of you who have installed your money here might be surprised to see how many of the writing systems on the rupee clay there are worth explaining the value of it .
i went home and i investigated a little bit , and i found some terrifying statistics .
ludwick marishane : a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , an early critic , and this is a passage that i just love , and i &apos;d like to read you .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it were , mother nature would have a problem : how on earth do we get chimpanzees to mate ?
this is the most difficult part , which is not obvious , and therefore i picked it up for the conclusion .
ok ? stop . that &apos;s enough now .
i don &apos;t know why there are pinke flamingos , but anyway , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
in fact , i suspect that the evolutionary biologists probably know a lot of reasons why we want to integrate new things very , very quickly .
it should look like this . you should see something like this .
bob mckim did another very -- another version of this exercise in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned this over time : you get a much better brainstorming , much more creative results if everybody thinks about the rules .
and all of a sudden , there was a productive conversation about design around a hand fixed object .
they &apos;re a little bit skeptical sometimes , i &apos;ll get back to that .
you know what it feels like , all this insecure , as long as you leave back in the corridor while the doctors are taking care of one of the sanitarities spaces , and you &apos;re wondering what &apos;s going on .
and so we would all feel secure and have a good time , because we agree on the rules and agree with it .
we do everything that leads to success , but then , when we &apos;re there , we believe that we &apos;ve done it . we reject ourselves and just stop doing all that we &apos;ve done successfully .
i was faster , but i was just as depressed .
i &apos;ve learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the soprano vocal group is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , forever , the last time in public .
he made sure that everything fits together .
there were 900 people participating in this .
and the second thing is that people obviously experience an actual connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberal democracies , society , not only allows us to determine our own self , but it demands us .
it means that we fulfill our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers , the kinds of questions i wanted to guide you through today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to use if you design something ?
and so i said , and my colleague , sebastian thrun , there has to be better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give you in the fall .
he pushes them in the right position , and he picks them up with his nose and sleeps .
we learned the first surprise .
there had to be any kind of explosive mechanism to grow the observed amount of force and the speed that we observe and the size of the system .
a load cell measures forces , and that &apos;s actually a beef load cell with a crystal inside .
this is the fanggarm -- here &apos;s the heel , and this is going to swing around and hitting the load cell .
a very , very convenient solution to the special problem .
and hawkes : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think this is one of the most beautiful classical submersibles ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other dive vehicles , i don &apos;t even know the remotely generated that this is a three-dimensional space .
now look at this -- he &apos;s just going to let me stand .
the submarine that was out last year was this one .
identical masses are the understanding of architecture as a disturbing , coherent -- please excuse the obvious example -- is not the right approach that we have to choose .
basically , new york was built on the back of the oyster fishermen , our streets above their dishes .
in those eight sideline chambers , little babyausters that are virtually claimed .
so you walked around in london and you were overwhelmed by this one .
finally , snow created a map of the eruption .
and this is what happens every second week .
i did her portion on the top of the jokhang temple .
and in this area of the amazon oil was discovered in 1972 .
the other side of the poet is tora bora , where it &apos;s supposed to actually stop osama bin laden , which is tribal area .
that was one of the great motivational factors .
this is the initial translation . let me now move forward and show you the hubly deep field .
but then you get to jupiter , and that &apos;s 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s going to be the part in which understanding the beginning of the universe is going to be .
we only have one million galaxies .
so the stuff that appears in the image is white , dark matter .
when you saw this image for the first time , you didn &apos;t see a lot of it .
this simulation was performed with 1,000 processors for a month , just to make this visible .
with planck , we hope to deploy , which is like this image of the earth , where you can actually recognize the complicated pattern of the earth .
and then , of course , we &apos;re stressed .
47 percent .
that &apos;s crazy . we do it all the time , even in the day-to-day life .
i got a vicious cycle . that led to lots of pain and problems with the joints , so that i couldn &apos;t keep anything .
so i was wondering , could you be more creative if you &apos;re going to be on purpose in terms of constraints ?
the whole thing didn &apos;t happen this morning .
the ongoing contribution of dosimeters is obligation , just like an official cup , and there &apos;s draconic restraints and perpetual monitor of the contamination .
stalin &apos;s straightforward famine in the &apos; 30s , the holodomor , killed millions of ukrainers . in the &apos; 40s , they saw the nazis , the metzes , raped , and many of the women were being thrown up when they were worker germany .
that &apos;s what makes the grief . &quot;
and when psychologist , i was most excited about this idea that we were able to use what we learned in the virtual world about us , and use our identity , to live a better life in the real world .
we get used to a new way of being alone .
human relationships are lush , chaotic and demand .
it dropped them .
because the moment people are alone , even for a few seconds , they become hibble , filling , scared , they get panic , they reach for an electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t win any of the score differences that some of our graduates had predicted , and quite often -- quite often , i felt that they had pushed their predictions on financial impressions .
maybe because my father used to read us at night .
so i &apos;d leave you with it -- but i had to do it properly , and i had to nurture it .
and finally , i thought of a pyramid , but i &apos;m not going to tell you the time to go closer .
even though you lose , you &apos;re not afraid of failure , if we &apos;ve given daycare everything , because who can ask more people than to give anything that he does .
if i should call a name on it , i never know an answer to it .
have i failed enough ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical trials , different types of stem cells are used for heart disease .
it &apos;s just last month that we &apos;ve done with this technology to show the creation of human liver tissue .
we can then map them and apply them to 360 degrees and analyze the kidney in all its volumetric properties , and then we can just take this information and then scan it through a computer footprint .
i couldn &apos;t go to school regular . i was just dirty .
i was a kid , i was like , &quot; yes , i want to . i want to do this surgery .
you may have noticed that there &apos;s a new area called swap trading .
and connected to this mengen-mania , there were examples around the world -- from the election of a president to the famous wikipedia and everything that lies between -- the presentations that could achieve the power of a lot .
third , pressing , dissolved environmental issues .
because what you need is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want cd , i want the music she plays .
my name is joseph and i &apos;m a member of parliament in kenya .
we have to get our women and our children away , we have to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
late night , i was driving home with batteries and ice .
together : does anybody have post-its ?
co : i decided to stay in the country to give up the master in moscow and full-time work to do this .
this can be huge expenditure , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the dollar value of the value of the number of deployed work for the cost of the city .
you have hotlines , spreadsheets and data .
so these are then , in the 18 minutes that i &apos;ve been told to speak here , between two and three thousand people who are going to be traveled to the cities .
and he was in a large-scale watering mud mud .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a legal sub-area district , then you have political activities at once .
i couldn &apos;t know that i was going to be part of a technological revolution that would make this dream come true .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same educational opportunities as i , helped me get through their engaged support , continuing qualifications in jura .
at the time , texting programs used only by writing , but by using a charitable flake scanner and language generators , he could develop a machine that could read any written .
but you know , i find it very lonely to let me read from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport those books across the border , in the various english countries , had to be read in different versions of different versions : britain , united states , canada , australia , new zealand had to have all different readers of harry potter .
the thirtcut . lifespan has been doubling since 1840 , and it &apos;s increasing at a rate of five hours a day .
one last thing . do you want people like me lucky , okay ?
secondly , the new machine age is such a good news , because once the androids work do , we don &apos;t have to do it anymore , and we save ourselves teeming and shooting .
the societal challenges for inequity should be accepted .
the economic game is surprisingly clear , and surprisingly incomplicated , especially in the short term .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world , with shillerning technologies , embedded into something harmful society and supported by an economy that provides inequality instead of opportunity .
over the years , i started to feel increasingly uncomfortable with this notion of god .
some people concluded that we can only believe in a god that divides our pain .
the second strope comes the line &quot; wind and waves obey him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big strip goat or tribal preserver ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by searching the god inside , by cultivating my own inwardness .
one of the first things i began to explore was the history of the words &quot; technology . &quot;
we haven &apos;t found neanderthal fossils that were older than 40 years , and the average age of these hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30 .
our body has been used to this new diet .
so this equality of energy and matter that einstein showed and shows the modern science of quantum computers , the entropy and information and matter and energy are all connected , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to put its own plug in to get more power .
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re looking for her a new job .
a great development that started billions of years ago moves through us and continues , and in a way , our choice is , in fact , because we &apos;re setting ourselves up with this force that is much more powerful than ourselves .
and they said , &quot; well , we have five classes every 30 to 40 students .
we take it all down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , refused bars , and it looked like this -- as we renovated somebody said , &quot; you know what , it looks like a ship hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat at the tables , and we waited .
there &apos;s a lot of symbiosis effects . the only problem , especially for the adults who work at mcsweeney , who didn &apos;t really know anything about all of this when they started , was that there was only a toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what to do .
about 170 tutors worked with you on the book , and this is how it worked beautifully .
and right behind -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- right behind them , they watched children being taught .
there &apos;s also this secret door -- it &apos;s a shelf you don &apos;t see if you make a chin , but it opens up slowly .
he &apos;s evangelish . he brings his cousins .
write him an email , he will ask you every question you can imagine .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s a side that thinks that peace is the end of the fight , and there &apos;s a side that thinks that peace is the creation of schools and employment .
she sent her kids to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s one that &apos;s called the complete idiots manual , &quot; did you know ?
there are idyllic roads on the cape cod , and we can drive everyone here .
this is my baby reina . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i &apos;ve always felt bad about this .
so i encountered this kind of complications .
i found that cheetos are very good material .
the university is most difficult , so number 10 is difficult .
of all in a peculiar hotel slide of clarity that &apos;s been searched over a window to the moment that the road was tested in front of my house black and that soft motts there was mortwining in the sun .
and i was reminded by the excellent presentation of karen armstrong reminds that religion really did not understand anything with belief , but having to do with behavior .
the north polar ice layer has seen , geographically , the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s exactly the same size of the united states , indicating a area that &apos;s about the same size of the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed world .
we can &apos;t wait for the dryness that australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the privilege that we have by assuming this challenge .
now , before i show you some pictures of what i &apos;m going to do , i want to point out this beautiful detail of scientists and design .
the rca is really an extraordinary school in these respects .
we discussed this morning with keith shrubb , that many scientists are not tend to show something beautiful in their talks , out of fear of being seen as dumb blondines .
so here &apos;s an example of how you can print textiles in 3d , which is very interesting .
so this makes us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little bit sharp .
we did the same thing for iraq .
this was a challenge that we had to face as a physicist .
we can push it high . the forces fragment more . there are more of them , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; naturally 7 &quot; beatboxes a whole band .
and there are some employees in foundations that call this &quot; compassion fatigue . &quot;
the idea of justice , which shows up our lives , and gives us a sense of what is right in life , which is just in life , what we should do , social justice .
and it &apos;s like this , and it &apos;s the most deadly he &apos;s at the preaching .
so every week the putzing force would come along . &quot; god , you &apos;ve heard me again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , an infection or a surgery .
the muscles were stared , paralyzed -- dystonically called this .
we &apos;re treating them with symptom-shifting drugs -- painful drugs -- those , frankly , in this kind of pain , are not very effective .
now they get so slowly a sense of how much rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was 1908 . it doesn &apos;t matter . i can live with that .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back rows at all . these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which launched one -- which was interpenetrated into the core of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , as i said , engineers .
the difference between dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can choose , and therefore we can change our future .
at that time , i led b92 , the only independent , to be precisely , the only electronic medium in the country .
and i thought that b92 would survive and a great company would be if milosevic had just disappeared , which turned out to be right .
and he says at the end of the meeting , &quot; look , it won &apos;t work , you &apos;ll never see your money again , but my foundation will put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , &quot; well , that &apos;s okay , let &apos;s get there , you get your business plan with what they actually do . &quot;
you see , we started in east and middle europe with our work and went to russia .
after a while , we opened a media management center .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea of spending bonds on the free press .
and in this way , you organize the funding , so that there are no dark chambers , no more blinds running around trying to find themselves .
so why does this work ? that &apos;s the question .
well , some people call it a theory of everything .
one simple example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which works like a divided by the square of the decrease between the attraction of each other .
the more symmetry you have , the better you turn out the simplicity and the elegance of the theory .
one of the things that he thought about today was given to most of us , but in his time it was not for granted .
it doesn &apos;t shut down the importance of these subjects to know that they &apos;re following basic laws , and they &apos;re coinciding .
but he was reading books in every moment he had , books .
and he returned from that ambition , he went back to the state parliament .
but when he was in the process of putting his signature under the proclamation , his hand was dive and shaking , because he &apos;d shook thousands of hands tomorrow during a new season .
not surprisingly -- there were only three women under the 16 pendiates in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand what an incredible privilege it was to have spent with this aging lion of a man so many hours .
and just as lincoln told the story , after the war came to the u.k.
i asked my father for tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
and the reason for that is that i will always be grateful for this strange love of history that allows me to spend a life in the back of the past .
he blew the temple and plumbed the temple .
this is the occasion , this object is evidence that the jews after the exile in babylon , after all the years that they were sitting on the rivers in babylon and remembering to jerusalem that these jews were allowed to go home .
all of these are respected by cyrus .
babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of babylon , marduk .
you all know what happened then .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of people living jews came to tehran in iran .
some know more about the conditions of life , but they still think they &apos;re a necessary environment .
the newly reviewed babies cried in the first few hours , but their needs were not satisfied , and at some point they didn &apos;t learn to take care of themselves anymore , within a few days , they were lustlos , lethargarian , and they were launching in the air , like everybody else .
a study shows that family centers 10 percent of home cost , while care costs about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i had almost spent my whole life in front of a camera .
you know very quickly what you have to do to find an answer .
it was 114 people there -- most of them were friends and family .
we listened to every single one .
but of course , he never did . the explanation never occurred .
and after many , many meetings , i was thrilled that this man , ahmad fawzi , was really one of my heroes and mentors , had managed to get inicef into the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan again .
they were the ones who believed in peace , and they believed in its possibilities , etc . , etc . -- and they were actually going to make it real .
we connect to olympia -- i met seb coe . i said , &quot; in london 2012 , it &apos;s about the gun peace .
it &apos;s about their voting districts , about their business .
the biggest brains of the world should also be the most cognitively capable .
i went through the scientific literature after the origin of that number , but i could never find it .
it &apos;s just a big primate brain .
and amazingly , that adds exactly what our ancestors may have invented 1.5 million years ago when they discovered cooking .
very simple approach to the high-tech conversations that i led .
and i think i &apos;m just standing at the beginning .
but as soon as the fight disappeared , the physical rehabilitation was exposed .
behind him was a child , his son , in red &apos;s face of effort to shoot his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
and on the evening , i spoke to my bosses at the headquarters , and i told them -- i said , &quot; look , we start with a couple of hours a day , just for some repairs . &quot;
two groups of the mujaheddin started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it about ? &quot;
&quot; yes , we have to increase production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
physiotherapy , not just in the orthopedic center , but also in people &apos;s homes .
and you should see me during a party .
and this hospital would have been able to afford pocklips .
why ? because the path i &apos;d taken was banned .
but i learned something deeper than that , which is that the leaders -- the manager of the economy of ghanas -- were making incredibly bad decisions that had brought our economy to collapse .
because i knew that the state of the african continent for my children and their children would be important .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience i had in swarthmore to africa .
is my time going down ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment where a great society can rise within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s very similar to the imaging yellow ball -- the sun that we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that half of you , more than half of you , will not be familiar with .
32 pills calm &apos;s forte .
live easy . &quot;
and these are the messages you &apos;re communicating to you ?
because the bottom line , the sponsors love it , and that &apos;s how it takes you all the time to watch tv .
a professional psychic talking to dead , she doesn &apos;t reach me ?
what is homoopathy ?
we &apos;d like to have suggestions of people like you , you know , state and municipal contacts to do something with it .
thank you .
and that &apos;s why the entire hospital goes only over a generator .
there must be something better . &quot;
but this is how the user can control , whether there &apos;s electricity right now or not , because you can control the rides on the base , how percent oxygen you have on your patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and secure device we can provide to hospitals .
the different types of writing in africa , the first one is protowrite , which illustrates the script of nsibidi , which is the written system of a secret society of the ejagham-people in southern nigeria .
anyway until 1998 , a yale-e-professor named john coleman darnell in the theater desert , discovered limestone climates in western egypt , who have been published in 1800 to 1900 b.c. , centuries before mesopotamia .
almost one fifth of all greenhouse gases comes from livestock -- that &apos;s more than traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and i like to industrialize animal stance and produce animals on the assembly line like tools , and it &apos;s not just fine .
enemies was a french matter of opportunity .
a picture of fish sticks would be even better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t really bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would think that maybe that wasn &apos;t that bad .
about a year ago , i asked myself a question : &quot; why am i , even though i know what i know , no vegetarian ? &quot;
on weekend , you have the choice .
you can make an image with an iphone and get all the names , even though it sometimes makes mistakes .
it stays distracted . it eventually wins the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you &apos;d think it &apos;s interesting to find more about it if the revenues are so high , but it &apos;s a very distorted area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big piece of art .
human nature had to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have an ethical level in conclusion -- is that they &apos;re also intrinsically valuable .
it could be more complicated in people , but maybe not very complicated .
jh : is it freely playing with these forces ?
and so i knew in a moment that i needed to have some remote control .
so there &apos;s attractive attraction , there &apos;s power , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of fluid .
and so i think you can be predictable .
this is a great assistant at the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and we swallow the individual slices while the boat is in the flight , and we &apos;re startling at us .
i was certainly 20 before i first went to an art museum .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria as you want to choose the works .
it &apos;s not photoshop .
they were interested in creating a newer , alternative dream , and they needed some money to do some interesting fundraising , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; lobesnest . &quot;
and so we went to the grave and we did this , it was hilarious -- the kind of attention we got .
and she describes how the dazzle -- everything she &apos;s like to say is because of the forbidden .
he &apos;s an australian elderly of aboriginal , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s in origami . so go .
people turned mathematical principles into art to understand the underlying law .
or they float it to the top and they make 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we found these rules with which you pack circles , you cover the pattern of circles with lines that include additional rules , and that gives the crease pattern .
you can do lots of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you might need some origami .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether you go to space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a locust in the state of washington with too much leisure time .
we only have three minutes . but we used to talk about it for hours .
and so i want to talk about this , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a chart , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women start flooding the labor market , and it &apos;s going to go down to today .
you gave instruction from the top .
because i write a book about all of this , i still do it , and so i don &apos;t have an answer .
and that was very daunting for them .
since we haven &apos;t completely processed this information , they come back to us in the form of pop culture , in this strange and overpowered way that you can see stereotypes change .
there &apos;s no man or there &apos;s no woman standing in the middle , and there &apos;s a cable to tip the cable .
where your personal income on a scale that &apos;s been consistent to consider inflation , more than doubled in that time , has almost tripled .
and to hear me and understand what i say , you already need about 60 bits per second .
it &apos;s still happening , so in the last book of me called the good business business , i interviewed some of the ceos that were described by their environment as very successfully and very ethical trade , with largely social responsibility .
control is always a safe thing , because you might feel in it , but it &apos;s not terribly arousing .
&quot; where were you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own significance of what &apos;s home , and they had their importance to community , and even for hostility that was given to them birth , they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond that .
more and more people are in the future or in the present , as well as in the past .
i went down to the room i was supposed to sleep in .
pico iyer : where is you home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . there &apos;s no gap anymore .
and let me show you why , by pushing back to the old-fashioned digital technology .
the child &apos;s survival is the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; your british and your mortality rate in heart disease is shocking . &quot;
but if you give people vitamin d supplements , you don &apos;t change the number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with cell cultures , let them grow , and then i worked with bone mouse models -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
you could be just as good at the equator in the summer .
surely many advances , many lives saved .
in fact , this is real photography , in time lapse , showing that the limb is regenerating in a few days .
and here on the right , you see what happened six months later , the most technically appropriate urethra .
a blood vessel is made out of two different cell types .
we then put it back into this oven-like device .
even more complex organs . by distance , the most complex solid organs are highly vascularized , with all sorts of bloodshed organs like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still at the experimentation .
we prefer cells that will not be rejected and not form tumors .
we just need five seconds .
for every problem out there , anybody would have an idea .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m actually a little bit of panic -- unlike all the suitcase and sugar that i had -- but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to go to a mba program .
i went from door to door and i sell license plate protectors .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would do that chairs .
that &apos;s pointless . &quot; you &apos;ve got to find a way to get faster on money .
i sold amounts of sunglasses .
they don &apos;t get a regular income , but they have the ability to find more tasks , and they learn the ability of negotiation , and they also learn the ability to find more possibilities .
when you go to a restaurant and you get poorly served , they show you what bad customer service looks like .
this boy , grasshoppers .
the development of today &apos;s student is to throw all the interests out of a board .
the novelty of basic skills or a minimum of cultural belnity emerged most of our students .
the values of the past are also being resurrected , and that &apos;s what brings a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a policy of principles , not partisan .
you have a mind . and you have other people .
what we should be looking at when we think about conservatives -- except this case from the 1980s -- what &apos;s all about : they go to the church .
sure , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another outcome , it has the potential to change how we interact with each other .
totally different .
in fact , that &apos;s not right organization , but clearly -- let me conclude this -- creative commons provides authors a simple way to enrich their content with the freedoms that they want to share with you .
john mccain .
and i &apos;m wondering how often this happens .
he told me that he brought the subjects in and then he said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to go there now . &quot;
so for today , i had the idea that i was running it through this process and showing you what this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general electric were also happy .
i survived , just in order for us to really understand .
i &apos;m always asked by people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way that microbes can spread is through human beings . architects like to put together spaces of similar typs to promote intermediate human interaction , or the exchange of ideas in tension , like labs and offices .
imagine a design that carries the microbes , for example , on an airplane or on a phone .
and no one knew about it .
my company , owl , built a system called guide for the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the hypertext conference .
and greenpeace wanted to put that in , and a method that you wanted to do that was actually planting one of these humpback whales into an orp chip .
on 78 percent of the voices . in order to give you an idea of the printed victory , rang 2 was in the celebrity scale only created three percent .
and the last message i want to share with you is that you can be successful online .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a great privilege it is to stand in front of you today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
one of the things we have in gando is clay pots .
simple like this .
good morning . magic is a great way to be the reality curve to make this possible today , which really makes science tomorrow .
there are the color red , and the color is black , and they stand for the constant shift from day to night .
voice : why not ? that &apos;s a very good slate .
that &apos;s an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , not as much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t lead a country like china , a civilization-state , based on a civilization , a system .
and the reason for that is , first of all , the state in china gets a very special -- enjoys a very special value than the representative , the embodiment and the hid of the chinese civilization , of the civilizational state .
it was in 1972 kilometers long , held beijing with hangzhou and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen that in terms of the g20 -- the position of the g7 rasant -- or the g8 .
he &apos;s driving along a street in the suburb , and the cars are driving underneath .
red = drums of the blue = bass green = ackorde orange is called leads violett equals pads the mouse piece made out of ...
and the first song was in english , the second one was in chinese .
she agreed her song .
i did graffiti , i wrote my name everywhere , used the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all accepted that their image was tied up next to each other .
&quot; you think you &apos;re going to have an israeli face -- that &apos;s a flu mass , right here ? &quot;
most of the places i went to , i decided to go because i heard about them in the media .
i took more photos , and we launched the project .
are you a non-governmental organization ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were covered , a woman named a woman , &quot; now god can see me . &quot;
because that &apos;s a big part of it . there are layers behind every photo .
but they basically took me a promise .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
if i think about the mesh and think about what &apos;s going on , why it &apos;s happening now , i think there are some factors that i want to give you as a backbone formation .
they &apos;ve solved a trend .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it &apos;s important to participate . cities have been given part of different kinds of welcome so far .
it &apos;s very cheap , and it &apos;s very meshy .
the last 40 years have been extraordinary times .
and also miniaturization .
that would make a significant consideration of things .
it &apos;s vital that at ted ideas , ideas that we &apos;re thinking about , are pointed forward and ensuring that this is going to be a particularly beautiful century , not one environmental disaster and eco-collapse .
my remaining family are boring academics who are involved in collecting members of elite teunis for our ambassador .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he was nuts , but some of them really stuck .
i was , like you , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since netra &apos;s been my career , i &apos;ve been suggesting that i &apos;ve achieved a lot of success .
i started exploring the dark displays of the human psyche .
this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein &apos;s honored to be here at ted 2006 between all the einstein &apos;s today . in fact , she &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you were to fall down .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , remember you ?
sw : big finale .
sw : what about a smore ?
my parents thought this was important for their internal rest .
when i have a talent , it &apos;s to take things apart from which i have indomestic layers .
the body has more density than the water . at least 95 percent of the body comes from itself .
and that &apos;s going to get you very far .
i asked him what that means .
at this point , you can , if you want to acquire multiple languages , and you can change them without influencing each other .
and she looked up at me , and she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s kind of better . &quot;
i think they agree with me that they look very well together .
and they &apos;ve done the tests with over 50,000 students so far , about a half a dozen schools , my readers , by the way .
we found -- and we were wrong with quite a lot of things and then we improved them -- but we found that the young people loved it .
geoff mulgan : a little introduction to the studio school
and finally , the only person who comes out is a young shepherd , and he goes to saul and he says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight him . &quot;
there &apos;s the cavalry , men on horses and with trucks .
goliath is lightweight prey . he doesn &apos;t have a chance .
so goliath is far greater than the same at the time , and usually there &apos;s an explanation for someone that far outside the norm .
and i think that &apos;s a very important lesson for all of us .
and it turns out that we are covered by a cloud of microbes , and most of the time these microbes do well , instead of killing us .
they &apos;ve cleaned up all the microbes , and then put the thin intestine into the receiver .
most pills , or the joghurts you can eat , contain one or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of gattings .
we need a book for the microbes that live in and on people so that we can understand what they &apos;re doing to our lives .
a lot of people think about the internet very much at the english world , but for us it &apos;s truly global . we have a lot of languages in many , many languages .
when you saw him a silly change on the side of me , you probably thought that all of this would be kind of flooring .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we &apos;re not talking much about truth and objectivity .
and we have over 40 irc channels , 40 mailinglists .
it &apos;s not a perfect rule , but it &apos;s enough for the beginning .
and i always like to say that she &apos;s the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , that &apos;s why ...
it seems to me that most of the textbooks that are used to training our children are taken from nature .
in the jungle of guatemala , in tikal , there &apos;s a temple .
a non-known kwakutl indians in southern alaska told it to a missionary in 1896 , and here it is .
it &apos;s far below your cognitive process .
we also found activity in other parts of the brain -- in parts of the brain that are associated with computation and loss .
i have a friend who &apos;s just done a terrible love affader .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we turn to each other , and we hold our views , &quot; and we talk .
tools like saw , knives , sickles or axes that i had wrapped into a handscarf .
i &apos;d been looking for a brush and a wide , but i &apos;d never been searching around .
in some parts of the earthquake , they use tools , like sponges to hunt fish .
so dolphins can squirt , and they can tickle from remotely .
take a look at how you synchronize with your partner and the other group of two .
but what we found very quickly is that free dolphins don &apos;t just depend on a boat on a keyboard .
we called this dolphin , we called &quot; tuchdiebin , &quot; because it &apos;s stretched by about 12 towels over the years .
but as we decode their natural sounds , we &apos;re also planning to put them back into the computer system .
and the word is invented .
there &apos;s yves rossy .
and especially if you &apos;re in the tracking position , you have the feeling to fly .
yr : i &apos;m just trying to be fit .
i &apos;ve been using this for the last 15 years , maybe 20 times -- never with this kind of wings , but at the beginning .
we don &apos;t tell their employer that .
but it was okay to agree on top and full of cacteas .
well , as a result of , as i guess what you saw would be explained by the invisible powers .
because this event has been the scientific revolution , since our knowledge of the physical world , and how we can adjust it to our needs , it &apos;s intangible to grow .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
yours is based on guesses ; our on the bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a misconstructed story .
and only if an explanation is good , it &apos;s also important that you can check it .
glasses are not very expensive . they have a lot of empire .
it &apos;s currently using about 30,000 of them .
what is minto a place ?
the new festival asks the audience to play an essential role in the performance creation .
she &apos;d met with others to look at &quot; the sultan &apos;s elephant , &quot; and that &apos;s all done well . &quot;
&quot; no fatal axy , that &apos;s good . &quot; first doctor : &quot; is you dizzy ? &quot;
i thought my career was over .
this is a bear where i was sitting on the rocks for a while .
this is a piece of multi-year ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you today pictures of belugawhales , greenland whales and narwhals and polar bears and leopard seals , but this is a picture that i &apos;ve done more than any other one i &apos;ve ever done .
people said , &quot; we knew they were malignant . we knew it . &quot;
and this seal took the penguin and was shooting it back and forth .
she swam away , she started a penguin .
she tried to feed my camera , which is the dream of any photographers .
paul nicklen : stories from a brightest wonderland
now open your eyes .
do you have a ring ?
you focus on this quest , please .
joe , we &apos;re doing that for so long , until you strap it .
funny , yeah , we have a little guy , a sheet , and we work all day up there .
as i said , she forms her reality .
well , first of all , we worked on building ushahidi and developing .
a call to the united states , after canada or china , it costs five kenya schilling , or 0.06 us dollars .
it &apos;s modular constructed , so that you can also close a satellite module and have internet access to remote places as well .
over time , the buildings got higher and bigger our technology has become increasingly better , so the mechanical systems have been enormously . they need huge amounts of energy .
imagine two americans travel together with italy .
now , please raise each other as liberals .
the best definition of &quot; thoughtful &quot; that i know -- explains so much -- comes from brain scientist gary marcus .
it lets us live out very , very old powers .
but look at the other three lines .
isn &apos;t that just the foundations of strangeness and authoritarism and puritanism ?
she went upwards and on and on and on .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws away from my body . &quot;
and we have the marks of shiva to the right , shiva is the liberal god -- and both of them work together .
and so the answer , in my opinion , is to use this passionate commitment to the truth , and try to turn it into a better future for all of us .
but if you react , there are a lot of other people in the environment who are innocent but could be hurt -- the military doesn &apos;t like to talk about collateral damage .
we look at something else , &quot; and we didn &apos;t seem to realize that the situations were actually quite comparable .
is there any commandment , how often if you think about how it was introduced , how often the police in queensland put pefferspray back then ?
there were just a few people who were shot in this incident .
it &apos;s 72 , and it looks like this is the most appropriate way to deal with it .
and if you &apos;re threatened to use them , people will be offered , but they shouldn &apos;t be causing a hurt . &quot;
we &apos;ve started organizing makers at our maker faire .
billy-bob , or billy bass , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about that , but just ...
but he also moved here to meet other people who did the same as he did .
this is &quot; makerbot . &quot;
and we have to put that into the schools , or in the communities in many , many ways -- the ability to create the world in order to form and reform the world around us .
there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and in fact , we see these glorified photos of stars all the time -- they &apos;re called them false shell photographs .
it doesn &apos;t look like a way , but you have to imagine your world mental .
stairs moving away from one , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s always given to you the illusion that if you buy this lamp , you will live in a world without wires .
the perfect romance -- symbolized by the perfect chain , with the perfect diamond .
because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive .
but i also knew how hard they were working for the whole week .
i did that a lot of strangers .
i heard about women who were punched in their beds , or balanced in their burka , who are left behind dead on parking lots with acid burns in their kitchen .
then i got cancer -- or i found out i had cancer .
my friend prepared this big dish , and i asked her , &quot; what is this ? &quot;
it was friends for me and a loving sister .
because we all are so badly equipped to imagine the inside of our fellow human experience and their secret intentions . &quot;
children take a long time to control the system .
rs : oha . now joshua goes off to take a drink .
rs : should ivan get in trouble for that now ?
and she &apos;s in the coffee of her friend .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you that this is a magical field .
i want you to tell me that you &apos;re not running if , let &apos;s say the pentagon calls for that .
but why do you even have to feel anything ?
and it was , you know , you know , a course for speed-yoga .
and secondly , is it possible , or is it worth longing , to slow down ?
they want to go back to a slower rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under the six most competitive nations in the world and working hours in which the average american would wine would .
but the new idea , the revolutionary idea of dexterity is that there &apos;s such thing as &quot; good slow . &quot;
i realize that the bedtime stories were like a forgotten assignment on my task list , it was dreadful to me , because they were so slow and i wanted to be done quickly .
and so everything took off , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build everything on an island ; some of it needs to stay on the bank because we don &apos;t want to go from the community . &quot;
i worked on it monthly , and i couldn &apos;t figure it out because i felt that people who &apos;d come out of the historical museum were already out of information , and if you see a museum with information , you wouldn &apos;t be able to process it anymore .
when i flew home , the foundations were planned .
but you see the uniqueness of the environment .
moshe safdie : building uniqueness
and when christian played a note -- for example , a f.
so in jazz , the bandstand is absolutely astonishing .
it &apos;s not about making my vision up or something like that .
am i interested ? am i standing for you ?
they had to come a lot of earthly to come here .
in the summer india is warming , it &apos;s getting extremely hot .
and the grown-up animal that comes after that lives another or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that at the time , but i know it today . these are hundreds of micro dragonflies .
and i got a little bit curious about that . i &apos;ll stop there , because i want to ask you . and here &apos;s a lot of people who -- of course , from india -- people who &apos;ve spent their childhood here .
so , the next thing i was on the phone .
october , november , december . that &apos;s not the northeast monsoon time .
okay , they &apos;re laying off their eggs at the time of the seasonal rains , during the monsoon gene .
it started just last week . the rain nuts started , and now it rains there .
it &apos;s a pretty incredible crafts .
incredible . this is the most extraordinary hike of a predatory bird at all . it &apos;s a pretty incredible immigration .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done from my life .
and everybody thought i was good . but on the new terrain , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what happened with mullen ? &quot;
the night before my surgery , i looked at them , and i said , &quot; how am i going to do that ? &quot;
next -- oh , look out . these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve done all this , what is it that drives you yet ? i &apos;ve told about knee surgery and other things , but what drives you ?
in my last tedtalk , about seven years ago .
but carl norden really cracked the code .
whenever the norden bombsight gets put into a plane , it &apos;s accompanied by a series of armed guards .
the chemical efabrik stretched over three square miles .
after the war was over , there was a review -- just like the army that the air force always does -- and they asked the question : how many scuds did we actually destroy ?
i &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a city or a journey like this shows the diversity of human species in astonishing ways .
we ask about human ancestry .
but what data does the theses based on ?
imagine that you have to write down .
it was an african based on the global diversity of y chromosome .
the sahara was much larger than it is today .
the people who were looking at killing animals specialized that they were chasing in the savants , moving north , following the grasslands about 45,000 years ago in the middle east in a raren moist phase of the sahara .
the human genome project , rover-missions on mars .
we know deeply in our hearts that the universe is not moving from mush to complexity .
so here we go .
what you see here , the blue areas are about a thousandth of cooler than the red areas .
the ones that work at smaller distances as gravity , which explains why you and i are smaller than the stars and planets .
you &apos;re going to be familiar with the double helix of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
now you might be wondering , &quot; what is this talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good when it comes to insurance .
and then you have to decide how to invest in your 52 choices , and you &apos;ve never heard of a monetary fund .
at least a wonderful study predicted that .
but if you get the driver &apos;s license , you will check the boxes if you don &apos;t want to donate the organs .
the other group gets two apples , one is taken away .
save more tomorrow just does it .
this is just one example .
it &apos;s a song about what &apos;s called a hummingbird , a creature that mimimics a creature that mimimics a creature .
hello , who &apos;s there , please ?
thank you .
knowledge has too much impact on life experience .
i &apos;m trying to get time to shame .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent their walter raleigh to separate their human part from their divine part .
do you expect a kid ?
elizabeth : get out of you ! get out of you !
i went to a friend of mine , and he left me wait in his appartment in malabar hill in the twentieth of the 20th , a really rich area in mumbai .
everything is a contradiction .
we &apos;ve lived on less than a dollar a day -- about 15 years .
and you have to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are worth more than grassroots forests . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t wake up a person who gives up to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just people ; it &apos;s about lifestyle change .
if on a limited planet should be all sustainable &#91; products &#93; , how can we do that ?
coke has to work with pepsi .
these are nine of them .
we ended up with , i think , 60 percent of the world &apos;s production on the table and 25 percent of the board .
it &apos;s not immensely .
but not only do they buy the juice ; they also buy the carbon in the trees to extend the carbon cost of the questioning that produces the product to europe .
so communication is interrupted between the brain and the spinal cord , which leads to a complete and permanent paralysis of the leg .
after a few years , we managed to develop an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that replaces the nervous system of the spinal cord from a sleeping state .
we worked hard for 10 years to get this goal .
after a couple of weeks of recovery , we &apos;re setting up a programmable pump to inject an individual drug cocktail right into the spinal cord .
and i was a kid in working-class .
he talked about the world as it is and the world as it should be , as it should be .
and by doing that , these women were flattening lots of obstacles out of the way .
in the white house , and the desk that he &apos;s sitting on is called &quot; resolute desk . &quot;
the last day , the woman who got there taking care of everything , and we talked a little bit about each other . suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you sing me a little bit ? &quot;
it &apos;s a little bit of a hymne to the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you can see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneous , and it &apos;s originally done .
they didn &apos;t have all that .
so the internet needs address and instructions .
one of the most popular websites in the world run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that youtube or google could have done about it .
and today , wikipedia is so omnipresent that you can even find it on the maps of restaurants in china .
and that &apos;s got wikipedia .
this is a blog that &apos;s dedicated to unfortunate portraitphotos .
why ? there &apos;s a passenger search for craigslist.com.
the world did not end in the &apos; 90s .
and we see that the influence of the environment on the learning performance in some countries is very , very strong .
all of this costs money .
and there &apos;s been a lot of undertaken to get students with migration-interests or socially weak families to give the same chances .
how are schools and teachers represented in the media ?
in bureaucratic school systems , teachers are left alone in classes , and they have to stay in a lot of teaching prescription .
some people say that the change of educational administration is similar to a cemetery .
but if you look at the issue of this perspective , you can see what happened over the last 60 years .
and i walked about 15 miles all morning to get to the pharmacy .
so this was obviously an unreplicable device .
we could also do that with phones .
so there &apos;s a business for them .
&quot; the government has to provide economically seductive services . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it was a long , long time ago when i was 24 years old , and i was a student at st. john &apos;s medical college in bangalore .
and you can see my card when i get them there .
and also , i bring an invention .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you can see that japan is going through a time of war , with low lifespan .
and they decided not only to invest in health and education , but they also started to grow the economy .
washington , d.c. went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
will the rich countries really embrace a completely different world economy , and the power shift from where they &apos;ve been back to 50 to 100 to 150 years from now to asia ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that doesn &apos;t explain the whole mass itself .
and now give you the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of truth model of what &apos;s going on during the gravitational effects .
they move away from each other because the space gets bigger .
by looking at things like galaxies clusters -- their particle density , how many of them there are in time as a function of time -- we can experience how dark matter and dark energy are competed with each other to form structure .
the big questions in physics .
sleepy man banjo boys : virtuoser bluegrass from ... new jersey ?
so recycling and reuse are major points here .
marc koska : 1.3 million reasons to reinvent plastic syringe
and in fact , there was this change in homosexual men in the united states during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and also lots of children .
in uganda , we see that the prevalence took off .
and this enables you to do this in pretty similar development .
but openness and connection has a prize when we think about diseases . it should not be a surprise .
coffee is utilitarian product .
emily oster , again , investigates aids statistics in africa from an economic perspective , and comes to a surprising conclusion : all of our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated because i was watching this kind of fine thing of italian pronounce paper .
he was called &quot; bullet train , &quot; called zug-boss , &quot; because he was rushing ahead , but every time he went into a tunnel , he built a pressure wave . when he went out of the tunnel , there was always a kind of sound loop .
these humps act like a magnet .
and then we &apos;re going to ask ourselves , why is the membrane clogging , and why it takes so much power .
for example , in the entrance of nanoparticles into a material .
in biomimicry guild , my consultancy company , we work with the architectural office hok architects .
janine benyus : using biomimicry
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and fortunately not boys .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india , because this has been once and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; all right , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a meditation program for over 1,000 inmates in this prison .
secondly , it &apos;s about the anti-corrupt movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we did a few years later , a form of captcha .
in fact , you do it by starting with an old book .
the number of pages that recaptcha are actually using is so high that the number of words that we digitize every day is very , very big .
some of them are kind of funny .
right now , the web is divided into multiple languages .
and then my favorite part of the question .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a valve .
but what is maybe even more surprising is the translations that we get from the site-users , even if they &apos;re just beginning , the translations that we get are as much as the professional translators , and that &apos;s very surprising .
because people , as they learn , they don &apos;t have to pay for money , they pay for their time .
the connected side , the company , does what it does really well .
building platers to the active participation is anything but normal .
and zipcar offers a very appealing , consistent service that works fabulous .
for aristotle , happiness was the highest good , the goal that everything else &apos;s going to work out .
maybe these people are right . they &apos;re wrong with their thoughts , maybe they &apos;re not good .
10 percent of the time , shut down the thoughts ... ... sex .
i played the violent african , the african terrorists .
now , from the first round of voting , no clearer went out -- so no one had achieved the absolute majority -- so the elections in a second round three weeks later were performed .
so here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
so i moved to la jolla and i learned surfing .
the people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know what this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we &apos;re breathing that for a particular reason and stuff .
and so , charles said , i &apos;m going to provide money , give you a building , and you can meet you there , but don &apos;t talk about religion there .
reality is what you can see .
i thought that everyone was going to do that with a little bit of mind .
just to see what would happen if you mixed the two .
so i have another thing that &apos;s not personal .
if you want to get rich today , entrepreneurs will .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it &apos;s not growing at all -- it &apos;s not growing at all . we &apos;ve been measuring that very carefully from satellites for 20 years , and it &apos;s not rising .
biochemist kary mullis talks about the foundations of modern science : the experiment . he shares stories from the 17th century and from his own rocket tree days in the garden and prizes the curiosity , inspiration and caring good science in all its forms .
i wanted to represent , in a simple way , a living body that inhabits these falling , decreppled spaces .
&quot; naked city &quot; is a nickname for new york and &quot; spine &quot; represents the melancholy and struggle that emerges from the feeling of foreign space in a urban environment .
i love traveling , and berlin became one of my favorite cities .
and all the time , i didn &apos;t see a single rat at any of these places until very recently , when i was traveling in the london channels .
the first question is , and you might write them , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or a virtual leaf in your head , and , in your home , you can try this as well .
and we then interrupt with , &quot; we are the best science high school in the world , &quot; because of our british hybris .
except that -- you &apos;re noticing -- well , in your ellipse , did you think , &quot; well , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and one of the hardest problems is , if people already have an idea of how everything works , it &apos;s quite difficult to change it .
and as an expert for organic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues who are different from the organic , life-like world and anorganic , empty world .
and you can see it fertilizes , germs , in a way , grows .
we actually have amazing forms of life that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself , in a letter to a colleague , imagined that life was likely to come somewhere in a warm little pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them together and literally thousands and thousands of really large nanomoleculars molecules , in the same size of dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not a carbon point .
we want to put them into the environment , and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make anorganic biology and make matter evolve , that will actually define life .
but there &apos;s a second reason why i like these developmental goals : every single one of them can be measured .
and these are highly professional female interviewer who sit for an hour with a woman and ask her when she was born .
i was actually sitting in front of my computer friday , and i could see how the mortality rate fell on that morning from 128 to 84 .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want more and more of it .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make any sense to calculate an average of improvement that wasn &apos;t , and that very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk that much about it .
in which there were high , or very high , child mortality and families were also very big , six to eight .
this is also a catar .
whatever remains worth more on money .
yes , i went barefoot until i was 12 .
and he said to them , &quot; is the uncontroversial question .
all the time there was a border .
and gandhian development , in my opinion , will make the world move forward , will make a difference , not just for a few , but for everyone .
... on top of the knee , yes , that would be hard ...
the development time -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everybody &apos;s needs , but not everybody &apos;s greed .
and mammals die .
i went to high school .
when i was at the council of scientific research -- 40 laboratories -- if two labs didn &apos;t talk to each other , i built teams .
they &apos;ve gone on to that , and i &apos;ve got apps at the app store now .
it &apos;s about perfecting something old and taking something old to the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but it &apos;s not more radioactive .
but because this reactor is not under high pressure , and chemical is not so reactive , it means that newspapers don &apos;t tend to leave the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i &apos;ve designed here can be an innovative source of energy that &apos;s going to be popular with electricity , and i &apos;m really willing to do that .
we move to an experience economy in which the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer that provides the radio network , in case it &apos;s running in the forest .
at the end of a long litany good advice he gives his son laughed , he says , &quot; first of all , be rejective to yourself .
you don &apos;t normally run a lot in los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot , out of this city .
and then they feel that they &apos;re wrong , as foam beats -- by evaluating properties that they don &apos;t have .
when i was little , i was very introverted , and i stayed alone .
and then it was just starting to start at one point and then build them to the end point .
so i made it out of concrete because it doesn &apos;t really matter .
that was this tool .
and to me , this is the most important thing , because since i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the cardiac chamber is getting 32 days : poor and hands are developing 36 days : the primitive invertebrate column is starting to form these weeks of time in which the fetus is making the fastest .
the complexity of building this in a single system is beyond any understanding or any math today .
because apparently , this unstable isotop lithium-6 is not in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectrasts ?
recently , a colleague from berkeley , gibor basri , sent me an email with a very interesting spectrum and said , &quot; can you take a look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- of massacks and masks of stars -- on which matter and chemical elements are made and regenerated in the universe .
because can you imagine that everything is searching ?
now imagine an object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain , and we just stand up and say , &quot; this is how we give up . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see nitrogen dioxide , and oxygen , i think we have the perfect e.t.
i was like , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you about this : it &apos;s universal ; we all have it .
i &apos;m slightly addicted to office articles , but this is another talk .
this led to a little breakdown -- -- which actually looked a little bit like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is this : no family stuff , no childhood shit . &quot;
what makes you feel vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you &apos;re not right . stop the valve .
we do as if what we do , we don &apos;t have an impact on other people .
people protocolated their meals in twitter , wind their children on the iphone .
so if we think about using them to do systematic improvements , then we also think about how they can be useful to our self-enhancement , our self-discovery and self-discovery .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time , because we wanted to find a new access to public health .
so steven is dividing his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this cyberkinetic implant , and these were the only patient data that was available online and available .
and here we have another paper .
you don &apos;t have any parachute , you have no data , you don &apos;t have scientific methods .
this is the trajectory of treatment intent .
but my brother didn &apos;t , he ended up with him .
if we went from here to the b-15 iceberg today , we would bump on something that &apos;s 300 meters up , 120 miles wide , and weighs the two gigatons .
in order to change the state , you just need two volts of a millisecond impulse .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better than that .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from what we call complexity science .
so , networks are ideal representations of complex systems .
and it also has an effect on systemic risk .
so we could have an influential influential influential to every shareholder .
we see the emergence of long-term and capital strong programs , which aim to understand our interconnected world from the standpoint of complexity .
water pipes have a fixed capacity with fixed pencil marks -- unless you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we &apos;d prepared 500 of these pieces of glass .
without human ingredients .
so we were up on our double bed .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that data is invented .
and my brain starts to think very quickly that this is an accurate of negative to positive in the world .
because this question requires that our external world can predict our happiness level , but the truth is that i can only predict 10 percent of the long-term happiness of a person if i take into account all the external world .
and that &apos;s scientifically incorrect and wrong for two reasons .
we get people to open their mailing program , a positive email from the lobs or the dank of writing to somebody in their social environment .
hard to say -- a family business story , you understand -- my father was the most profoundly man in the world .
and so i switched . i went to mit , graduated .
they said , make it hold .
they take a giant disk out of cardboard .
he was the first digital media producer in toko .
do you hear that ? how cows ? this is in logan in the morning 4 a.m.
so there &apos;s all these things to do , but most of all , i love to experience the world , to taste .
and i followed this with passion .
their culture doesn &apos;t arrive in schools , and i want to get you to figure out how to overcome this problem .
and that makes you nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools where there are no boys .
and over little moments in my life .
or mothers who have educated boys ?
we need to change attitudes to boys in elementary school .
and you &apos;ve got the impression that you think that &apos;s okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that this &quot; why &quot; asking hints can give us about the fundamental principles of nature .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to try to do at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really an important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really affect the object .
we made a newspaper , for example , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s connected to my ipad , and that &apos;s a piece of software that &apos;s running on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add an interaction system , so i added it to a kind of conversational sensor , so that people react differently in the glass when you get to it .
from my current day i &apos;m going to turn to a middle-aged man , and then to an old man .
50kg allowed for extra .
radio : what do you think of it ?
just fold the wings together , and keep going .
so i &apos;m going to ask you a different question .
and he put a royal gardens with wax men who had instructed to wake him day and night , but with the secret instructions , not very good at waking him .
because they found that loss avoidance determines human behavior strongly .
and yet , we have to now create a much diverse media ecosystem in which you can create this kind of value , and it &apos;s also a lot of fairer .
now , if we have all of these resources available , we just have to ask ourselves the question -- and thaler and sunstein have done this -- how we &apos;re using these smart people .
they lead the new diamond shreddies .
they give small , trivial everyday renommee .
i felt passion , soul and heart , had left my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not without .
all around us around us , elevated around us , there &apos;s another replicator in this prime-time soup of culture .
you &apos;ve probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than space for them all .
we are the only gene and meme machines .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
this was dangerous , but hello .
they &apos;re using us to look at the resource of the planet to produce more and more calculators , and more astonishing things that we &apos;re hearing about here at ted .
and are we going to get through that third danger , how do we passed the second and first ?

it will not cost us anymore if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had burning about 70 percent of my body , it took about an hour .

it wasn &apos;t that the more religious people -- those who got more commandments -- would have cheated less , and that the less religious -- those who could have remembered almost no more complaining -- more would have cheated .
so if you don &apos;t think about money directly for a few seconds , because you get a brand , does that make a difference ?

i think all of these forces have very bad impacts on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in the commercial industry .
these are the harmlet that i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon is defined to the brand and competing with the notenbank , how they want to spend their money , which is money and what money is and what it is .
maybe that seems too much of a leap ?
i don &apos;t have to explain it to the audience -- last week i had to explain it to my nine-year-olds -- penisse are structures that transport spermies from one individual to another .
and i already knew that animals like the rainworm here , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissues by putting them on bones .

they have to be very cheap to have them available .
but could not be done for that angle of the labor market ?
they demanded by the governments of supporting rupees , and in many cases , they also got them .
but let &apos;s suppose our goal is to bring new economic action to the base of the pyramid .
because they needed a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their revenues .
he liked sitting on her lap because he said it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
since 1920 , when sir arhur eddington and presented the british society for science , that &apos;s why the sun seems to be .
so , what is fusion ? there &apos;s something nuclear physics here .
and that energy is what the fusion fires .
it &apos;s about the same as a conventional power station .
we have to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also a powerful influence .
in fact , they wanted the most democracy , but they were the population of all countries that had stated the most rare within the last month , had expressed their opinion of an officer -- it was only four percent .

so the question goes , &quot; what drives male support for women &apos;s rights ? &quot;

this is not natural for a rocket .
it weighs less than an aa-battery .
from the smallest lufthalso to the sheer forces of nature &apos;s storms .
we can afford to contribute as individuals and get ourselves heard .

we didn &apos;t fly it in the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that really flew .

and the director was kind of amusing , and he told me that he thought i was crazy , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a radiant . these guys are severe offenders .
it took several events like this until i found out what to do .
when i started this program four years ago , my original plan was to create a seventh team of underdogs .
and they look down to yokneam , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that 15 years ago i had the courage to give up my post at nyu life-time to come back to my homeland , where i can make these incredible tribes with this group of disturbing children from thiopia , marocco and russia .
and how often would my self have to die before i realized that it didn &apos;t exist from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly enough , these insights didn &apos;t heal my sense of self-esteem , that sense of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have a self , which was in between .
imagine what kind of existence we might have , if we honored the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life and the pleasure of what &apos;s next .
and this is a cafe on the sea in the u.k.
but instead of looking at it , we focused on the way it works .
we also discovered that how a more efficient structure and a cost-saving way would get through this structure .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project is happening right now -- but that seeds -- are not being displayed in the leading botanical gardens .
we worked with a manufacturer to develop a miniversion of the seed cathedral , so that , even if you &apos;re visually impaired , so it was kind of crappy and soft , the piece of landscape you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few sits you see , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book is called &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular notion that the human mind is a blank slate and all its structure of its socialization , culture , education and experience .

another one of the mental and art sciences at the universities that are actually in many ways in the decline .
now , the other hot iron is the education of children .
and i think you can &apos;t say that any better at all .

i don &apos;t like what i think at the moment . &quot;

so i wondered what would happen if we challenge some of these secret floods .
right ?
it &apos;s this way -- we &apos;ve explained the work of war as a society , each of us .
your iphone without the people who do the same shell , the same circuits , the same keyboard , make the same keyboard over and over again .

and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , is it true you &apos;ve got a vessel in here ? &quot;
but how do you sit in a sane way ?
so all of the things that tony got to do was get the normal proof that , according to his clinician , he was insane in this new way .

when the treasure sank in 2000 , it was the culmination of the best breeding time the scientists had ever done for african penguins at this point -- which was an endangered species .
and the day after our arrival , two of us were entered with the division of space two : space contains two more than 4,000 oiled penguins .
we used this method in the treasure rescue again .
and this is really important , because the african penguin was declared a year ago .

and achilles takes hector &apos;s leichnam and gives him carefully at his father , and the two men look at each other and recognize each other as divine .
this view of the cells has really drawn me into biology and science , looking at living cells in the microscope .
each grain of sand has one tenth of a millimeter .
you can see these micrometeorites .
this picture was the beginning of x-ray technology .
we all look the same from the inside , trust me .
the walls are 700 mm thick , solid concrete .
and this on the left is an x-ray .
it has human associations .
in the x-ray , we see all the little surveys in the corners .
i had to go through the car in the middle , and yet i didn &apos;t have to do a really simple task .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys writing machines for a week , and after this week , they just used them as a toilet .
science actually says we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m going to spill a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
how do we know it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we didn &apos;t agree either of them .
not professor and judgment , only two spirits , ready to philosophize .
and then my life was fine .
all i saw in making was that there were real arguments between the enemies between the growers and the hunter-gatherers .
now would it be time to process that information ?
we spent a lot of time studying a $ 1 billion store -- they &apos;re getting right -- they &apos;re studying a billion dollar oil shop that was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but more later .
and then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were disturbed that these shell companies had rapidly sold on their assets , and the most important in london &apos;s mining companies benefited very much about it .
it &apos;s too complex and hard to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all getting old . we &apos;re all getting sick . people are leaving us .
there are places you can &apos;t go , there are places you can &apos;t think of , worlds you can &apos;t live any longer .

i miss michael .
but he didn &apos;t find that , though , his staff would sneak him up and say , &quot; you &apos;re going to go to the rehab , or you &apos;re fired and dies . &quot;

if it &apos;s on the carton , which is the opposite side , it &apos;s forming .
the characteristics that the word kindish speaks are so often to see in adults that we should discriminate this old discriminating word when it comes to criticize behavior associated with accountability and irrational thinking .
if i can doubt my sister &apos;s ability to pay 10 percent zines that i &apos;ve been handing on your last loan , i &apos;m going to restrict your skill to get more money from me until she pays it back .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live in the dark times anymore .
and the third one is all the sounds that we create people , the anthrophony .
this is after selective waste .
there are lots of facets of soundscapes , among other things , the way animals have taught us to dance and sing , that i pick up for another time .

and if you &apos;re wondering how much this is , this ebay-logo is 16 kb .
so 37 is our demographic .
it &apos;s very impressive , and it &apos;s a very beautiful concert .
and these are the themes that are actually at the heart of us .
a generation that makes so much more meaning of video games than it &apos;s made out of the real world .
these are all problems outside my iphone .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games is for our civilization .
end ! end ! that &apos;s it .
he &apos;d like it really well .
so , you get quickly from the simple to the complex , if you do more . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they had to look at it , and it was continuously -- i thought at least that time , until she explained to me that was to break you out something so you could think about it .
it lets it go the other way .
girl : there was a sphere and a foam ball , because it &apos;s two completely different devotes , and if you fall at the same time , they might just fall off the same quickly .
but we couldn &apos;t make a thousand new teachers to save our lives .

at the end of the day , we &apos;re going to change ourselves the way we &apos;ve changed the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have incredible impacts .
why do they do what they do ?
everybody would want the new version .
they make us too much .
they &apos;re going to warm even at this point .
i &apos;m going to repeat his words in order .
&quot; well , yes , &quot; i said , &quot; weird you ask that .
and she goes , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do that again . &quot;
we looked at them , and i was grateful because she just said , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s insane . &quot;
the project &apos;s goal is very simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in top-form .
now the answer is a multidisciplinary team .
i work with the imperial and the brompton , which caused some serious problems with the project that shouldn &apos;t have been there .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want change , they &apos;re not right , if there &apos;s a confined engineer who has the answer parat .

no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the dozo .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to draw nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth &quot; taught me a lot about the meeting with the audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of animals on the planet as they &apos;ve been here before , until we get to the second microbial era .
its impact is the distribution of these very thin headquarters across the entire planet , and we had a very generous death of dinosaurs , the death of these beautiful ammonites , leconteiceras here , and celaeceras on here and so much otherwise .
it &apos;s the supreme meat , the t. rex of his time .
they hate us animals .
this is when material comes out of the depths of the earth and the surface , spread across the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m 13 miles away from shore , what &apos;s going to happen to me ?
they have a crash . they have two options : they will die , or they will take the hydrogen sulfide , and , let &apos;s say , 75 percent of them will be saved , mental .
pw : blessing and curse .
some of them are countries who believe that deregulation or even not regulation is the best way to attract investment , to promote trade .
and the answer is simple : the chinese define these factories as chemical operations , not as pharmaceutical , and don &apos;t test them .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can at least use my office to bring them all together to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now we have a sense that it &apos;s the beginning of a new way of regulation international tasks .
human rights become a very simple question : can i give this person back ?

to make sure that as little as possible we can walk wrong , we have all these procedures in the election .
so you &apos;re picking this way .
but this is a wider and quite difficult topic , so i had to constraint myself .
the size of the population -- big china here , big india .
and in all the eastern religions out of japan , the level was the same .
because a child &apos;s death is compressed with another child .
and what &apos;s the reason in qatar ?
they have a great teaching value .
all religions in the world are able to maintain their values and adapt to this new world .
and then , like all of our generation , we lived in a himalayacloster .
day eight .
in india alone , my 150,00 best friends and i went from door to door with this same picture , to every single house in india , and we went to over a billion households .
this is the surveillance system .
i asked them -- they &apos;re all grippi psychologists -- and i asked them those questions that you &apos;d like to ask .
i think we debt the gphin and ron st. john very gratitude , i hope ron is somewhere in the audience over there -- he &apos;s the founder of gphin .

at the end of our lunch , we realized the openness of the other .
as usual as i would go back to bangalore and often too lively discussions with my friends at home , where we were discussing different subjects while they complained about new causal openings , where a drink costs a drink a lot more than what they were paying their 14 year-old girls .
he looks for forgiveness , and he claims he wants to make his child &apos;s life better .
this contingent seemed quite happy , and it had no fatalities yet to be done , even though a dozens of peace soldiers had been killed in liberia .
and how are we responsible for this ?
it &apos;s frightening -- isn &apos;t it ? -- -- that the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job , that a small group of activists is capable of publishing more of this kind of information than the rest of the world &apos;s press together .
j yeah . this was the front page in the guardian , and it was then printed around kenya in all countries in the tanzanian and south african press .
j the implications to the people who worked on it were sizable .
and there &apos;s a lot of information .
i would be interested , just because of what we &apos;ve heard before -- i &apos;m curious about the ted audience &apos;s opinion .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with the term hacker .
and just a month ago , all of this was offered by the isforeign parliament .
and from all of these numbers , i &apos;ll start with just two or three variables .
this piece here can be read very differently depending on where you put it .

and this insight is incredibly powerful for chemotherapy efficiency , maybe for many different types of cancer .
for example , volatile organic compounds of chemical pollutants found in our schools , hot and workplace .
because all of these solutions are , of course , they are sustainable , and they are long-term investments -- long-term investments for our generation and for the following generations .
and immediately a voice called , &quot; kangaroo ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came up to me , men and women .

about 80 percent of these microbloggers are young people , under 30 .

this insight is incredibly disheartening , incredibly disheartening .
okay , i don &apos;t want to alert anybody here , but i &apos;ve just noticed that the person on the right is a liar next to you .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t look fat in it , no . &quot;

when i was 10 , i read james baldwins &quot; another country , &quot; and on this book i was broken .
a new song i told you .
so i took a little bit of time to study coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you incentivize them based on the effects that they &apos;re acting on these remote villages ?
not so attractive to me as &quot; waving flag . &quot;
they &apos;re waiting to be cut for it .
a lot more people would have been put together .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first , what we &apos;ve lost , and secondly , how we regain it .
here you can see the largest part of the florida key marine protected creatures .
if there &apos;s no fisheries on a reef , because it &apos;s legal , or divorced , that &apos;s great .
after a few years , after five to seven years , the fish come back , they eat the sea urchins , and then the algae grow again .
you can see the border of the protected area , because that &apos;s where the boats are all linked together .
if it &apos;s so good , if that &apos;s so simple , how much is it ?
so , protecting the coast and the sea has become a sink for money from governments and philanthropic facilities , and that &apos;s not accessible .
in the coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the equivalent of serengeti , where five lions come to a gnu .

they also have the mathematical structure that talks about grips , measurements , foundations , points , axes and so on .
the students have to work this . they have to formulate them .
and the best part , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer from the answer to the end of the teacher version .
what has happened to the small hadron collider ?
this is where they find the world &apos;s fastest growing young population .
it &apos;s private schools . there are no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer installing at the entrance of their slum being installed by a revolutionary social entrepreneur called sugata mitra , who took over the most radical experiments that showed that kids can be appalled with particular requirements , self-help from a computer .
now , the key is motivation , and it &apos;s in two ways .
this is a school in a bus at a building site in pune , the fastest growing city of asia .
you should turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s .
there are formal frames , schools , wedding hospitals where innovation can happen , and informal environments , communities , families , social networks .
every child to the age of 15 who wants to have a place in a school will be able to get you in 2015 .

think about it .
and i was scared .
about three years ago , i read an article in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us become what we could have been .
this is how evolution works .
and in fact , here &apos;s this insect .
i cut one guy a little earlier .
it warms not only to 43 to 44 degrees fahrenheit for about two days , but it keeps a constant temperature .
but the contrast is going to be something like this . it &apos;s sticking out in front of the background .
here the americans beat russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
she started to tell me about it , and all parents here will recognize the key words .
i have an irish prehistory .
our lives are determined by data , and the presentation of this data , for us , is an opportunity to create fantastic interfaces that can tell great stories .
i also took a look at the different perimeter , because you can select what you want to highlight from the data set .
it &apos;s an leg guy sitting in the box controlling this chess player .
a collection speed of about 11 sheep an hour , which is a 68 cents stunt wage .
because of that , what you see on the left is the original frame , and on the right , you see the frame being interpreted by 16 people who had no idea what they were doing .
daisy bell : daisy , daisy ... aaron koblin : and we took all these pieces and we put them into another mechanical turk question .
but we knew that , surely , we needed the right person to put us in there , and we could build something for .
and under that , all the frames that people submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i did rivers of pictures , slices , and i added them together in portfolios .
an unpredicted consequence of that is that you only see one part of the picture , and that leads to a very free way of building .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , just like the earthquake in haiti in 2010 .
then i walked 50 miles , then 60 kilometers .
it &apos;s like the different layers that we &apos;re made of , and what we &apos;re presenting to the world as our identity .
another glass project is in a public library in san jose , california .
so each building has its own personality .
it &apos;s perhaps easier today than ever to ensure a good outcome .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly materialistic .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , at the middle ages , in england , when you met somebody who was very poor , you called this &quot; miserable . &quot; literally , someone who was the lucky , the fate , was not holding : an unfortunate one .
and this is what he &apos;s going to do in the youngest dishes with angels and tropics , and the sky will open .
i told them the action of madame bovary .
what i think really talked about is success and failure .
we should make sure that it &apos;s ours that we really are the creators of our own ambitions .
alain de botton : a more friendly , gentler success in favor
if you train for this sport , you don &apos;t smile .
you know , you &apos;re swimming with smiling goggles , and you &apos;re swimming 60 trains a minute , so you &apos;re never really focusing on something , you don &apos;t see well .
they &apos;ve immersed the fluid .
my breath is down to three breath the minute .
they were supposed to worry about me ; i wasn &apos;t about them .
i swam on this thing .
it &apos;s the only swim that i &apos;m interested in .
this is already out today .
the gateway can be a smartphone , or it could be a specially unified gateway , like many of these things are gateways today , because they &apos;re not so well-integrated .
many of you have got the phillips direct life .
this is an important part of our lives . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . now let &apos;s go from sleep to diseases .
so we can change medicine in the field of care , in all ages , from spring or unborn children to the elderly ; pharmaceutical arena changes ; the entire spectrum of the disease -- i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of it -- around the globe .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you of this -- the effects on health care resources are enormous , and the effects on diseases are equally impressive in all of these different diseases and more .
how do we create robust societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a particular named alvin is created , and he says , maybe that &apos;s not the best way to go , and it &apos;s destroyed the whole system .
and so no labor would be present .
and it &apos;s a great thing .
fertilizers should be faster .
you might be wondering how to make these slices .
ours is the only cookbook in the world where we have a partial differential equation .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is always a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more businessmen than doctors .
but ultimately , the woke awakened .
they had to give up their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i told you about the great complicated robot .
and as you can see it coming out there to do something useful , it can &apos;t be stuck there that way .
and we don &apos;t even have to be constrained by these macro-eye .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was partly my fault .
we have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic waste , but also that the openness to unknowledge and enabling the risks of unexpected discoveries .
the movie we &apos;re going to see in a moment , did for the world exhibition in new york .
i &apos;m not an exception there .
it went on . they always tried to make things better and better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house short . &quot;
i think in my family , we were very lucky , because we &apos;ve learned design backwards .
dawn , very good !
ed : and then embassy row is really an historic center , because in the kymaerican history , the pariser diaspora here took her start where the message was standing .
see this chair there ? the orange one ? that &apos;s the organic chair . 1940 .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to go .
these were news stories full of outrage , they were full of speculation . they were anecdotic . no solid information .
one of them is known : population explosion , the world &apos;s population increased from two to nearly seven billion people over the last 50 years .
brent lawson : nice to be here .
you can see the lines cross when the population sex explosion takes place .
before i even talk about the cost , i have to be very clear that .
this is actually how liberation looks .
but only recently , thanks to technical advances , we can now demonstrate quantum levitation and quantum locking .
first , some strands of magnetic field are trapped inside , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like it when they move , because their movements use energy , and the superconducting disorder .
and of course , these round magnets , i can expand , of course , to form any glide .
and it was inspired by this quote by douglas adams , and the situation is from &quot; by hitchhiking through the galaxy . &quot;
because , of course , they &apos;re not explaining how to do this , if you want to do it yourself and you don &apos;t have a reporter .
but even though they weren &apos;t convinced , they said , &quot; okay , we &apos;ll call back . &quot; they never have .
tt : yeah , i have .
so some people will say , &quot; what will happen if moore &apos;s law envelopes on its borders ? &quot;
today , they can buy half a billion , and they &apos;re even better , because they &apos;re faster .
but where are we going to get the software ?
larry page has given a passionate talk on our founding event where he encountered to make these great challenges of humanity .
they wanted to catch the fish .
this may sound insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly frightening to hear a lot of scaffolding that another wave greater than the last one , will come to close to 13 o &apos;clock , or maybe tonight or ...
so the tsunami can be seen as a sort of a seminal moment , a moment when the blogosphere was actually grown in .
it &apos;s probably within three to five percent of the number of jellybeans in the glass , and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody has a link , so they link , etc . , etc . , etc .
it ends its explanations , and i &apos;m waiting for a 300-pound packaging sheet of paper with more accurate plans , but he just says , &quot; that &apos;s all i want you to do . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now at the end of 30 seconds of the thing without the skin .
this habitat covers more of the earth &apos;s land than all the other habitats combined .
many of us , i &apos;m involved in this , think that the exploitation of the oceans has only been seriously in humans in the last 50 or maybe 100 years .
these over a wire connected vehicles are our eyes and hands for the work on the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a barcode on this product that tells the computer exactly what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do that , we just don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a brand new article that &apos;s going to be on plos biology in the journal .
but that &apos;s not all the time .
as an architect , i have this idea of confronting .
mitchell joachim : don &apos;t build a house , grow it !
i find this very interesting and very proactive , because what you &apos;ve heard over the last few days is the sense of walking in different directions : directions that are specific and unique to the problems .
now , we all think that shelley was obviously a big romantic poet , a lot of us forget that he wrote some wonderful essays , and the most famous essay is an essay called &quot; a defense of poetry . &quot;
i &apos;m going to read this to you .
and at a certain time of his life , they inhabit on rocks .
but let me show you the latest robotic technology .
if you used to , in front of the digital radio , put the radio channel in and i heard &quot; crawling kk &quot; on the desired one , that was this noise .
the basic idea of bayesian inferences is that you have two sources of information that comes from .
that means that i have to make predictions about the future .
well , there &apos;s a very clear example of where one of me felt like a very different sense of sensation than when he was made by another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person plays .
if these cars were on a race court , they wouldn &apos;t have any idea what was going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain a large part of the data -- people are actually planning their movements in order to minimize the negative effects of noise .
this is from the passage of mariner iv .
mars has the biggest attributes of the solar system , the psychas-basin .
this is my favorite picture . it was just taken a couple of weeks ago .
the oldest rock on earth is only 3.6 billion .
and the result of our meeting was a rocket powered robotic airplane called ares .
we fold it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
this is about tilamook , oregon .
i think on the packaging , let &apos;s look here -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold these weapons for lego , because lego -- who flourns -- no , they &apos;re not on guns .
and then there are some examples of this stuff that are real sculptures .
i have to tell you , for me , it had changed everything for this night .
perhaps most importantly , the impact on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is very low .
in brazil , there are now 29,000 ethanol gas pumps , whereas the u.s. only has 700 , and poor two in california -- and within three years , the percentage of flexible fuel-fuel-vehicles have gone up from four percent to 85 percent .
this is not essential . biofuels are a really big thing .
scientists tell us -- and these are just estimates -- that we have to halve the output of greenhouse gasses , and that &apos;s as fast as possible .
i can &apos;t wait what we &apos;re going to do tedsters against the crisis .
there are fewer and fewer people who are still available to be stuck , and then you get this plateu of the curve , and you get this classic sigmoidal curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and this is happening on every outside node .
the red dots will be the flu cases , and the yellow dots will be some of the people with flu friends .
would you get immunity on population level ?
and there are , i think , three ways that these massive v-passive data can be used .
the building was built up to the collapse of venezolan economy and the death of the contractor in the early &apos; 90s .
even though it seems to be a totally chaotic place , if you see it from above , there seems to be a whole web of water because of channels that connect every single house .
in this tradition , the future consumer shows all your possessions that will soon bring you to your new husband .
what makes a place like the torre david particularly remarkable is this kind of skeletal micking where people have a base that they can use .
we can just ask , &quot; how are the rentiors of christmas ? &quot; and experience it immediately -- or what else we want to ask .
it &apos;s replaced the workers with technology .
you can see some symbols on the left in the screen that show what &apos;s going on with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older and older .
or even if we get much older , we get to drive our cars so that we can visit people .
they have disappeared in a moment .
it became increasingly obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me get the outcome on the screen .
one of the journalists said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the evangelical have come along , just like jewish bandages .
i think there are some , actually , many reasons , but there are just a few of the reasons that we &apos;re focusing on very quickly .
he was dressed by the flames , and he chased them , he was like a slope for the light , a little bit of an adrenaline junkie .
let me go from door to the international community and see if someone gives me police forces or troops for that division .
but it was too late for sergio .
he saw them .
samantha power : a complicated hero
this means jobs and opportunities along the whole value chain .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the accessibility of food because it was actually this year , last year and 2008 , while the famine crisis was there enough food , for every 2,700 kilos of calories .
and i go into these stores , if you are there , or you go out into the fields to see what you can get , and i realize you can &apos;t get food .
we see changes in participating in schools through girls .
i want to talk about what i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , they invest in a school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing with cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a breast cancer clinic any longer .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a scary device , not because it shows me how many kilocalories i use every day , but because it monitors 24 hours of what i do .
it has never been shown .
so the power of this magnet is so large that with this technique , we can see a single neutron with this technique .
you don &apos;t have to shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is large enough , and its resolution is high enough , you can actually detect all the proteins in the body and start to understand the individual system .
most of us find this commonly , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute are about the staggering frequency of a sleeping person .
if , for example , i walk this -- longer than a few seconds , you would feel uncomfortable , longer than a few minutes , and you would leave the room in shame .
and that &apos;s all recognized . and that &apos;s the melody that &apos;s most common in the world right now .
and i stood there with two very good friends of mine , richard weber and kevin vallely .
while we &apos;re crossing miles and miles of sastrugi -- frozen ice sneeverweep that could be deep .
as i stand here today and talk to you , i &apos;ve been talking about the overall of about five years .
just 10 miles off the coast , 381 meters down .
the oceans determine climate and weather , they hold temperature stable and forms the chemistry of the world .
one-ory-travel there are easy ...
this is the outcome if you don &apos;t know that there are boundaries for what we can take on the ocean .
in the last three years , the united states , for example , has done 80,000 square miles of sea than national memories .
we need deep submarines , new technologies to explore the ocean .
a lot of my early career i wanted to figure out how the wings of insects generate enough power to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s look at this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of the optical neural neuron from a mouse by jeff lichtman &apos;s lab , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they select a cell sentence to trigger any behavior , a different neural regler has a different cell set and patterns , and you can think that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a detailed and realistic computer model of the human brain .
it &apos;s home and drinks tea .
and as you zoom in on the surface of the neocortex , it turns out that it &apos;s made of small components . g5 processors , like in a computer .
how many per typus tree are there ? where are they positioned ?
we can look at the tissue , and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own processor , activate it , and see what happens .
henrsy markram says the secrets of the brain can be solved soon . mental illness , memory , perception : it &apos;s made of neurons and electrical signals , and it &apos;s planned to find them with a supercomputer that delivers the brain with 100 .000.000.0000,000 synapses .
it would take two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started to build smaller models with it , and started this .
this is what nasa did to get an eight-man version that would go to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write , because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom one ? yellow .
when you ask people this question , you usually think it has something to do with culture .
the countries on the right , those who give a lot , they have a slightly different form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but to bring it back , all of a sudden more complex .
an online abo for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we don &apos;t really know our preferences that well .
in fact , in medical expressions , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared -- you can only use to protect your eyes with low energy .
their intensity can be varied very quickly , and it can be turned out very quickly .
they are critical .
but that &apos;s just by the way .
cars have led lights and led-back lights , and they can communicate with each other , and they can communicate through the databouts that can communicate with the cars and so on .
dna is what life is mean .
because , in fact , it &apos;s not that many data .
you give the apotheker your genome , and the power of that is a customized medicine that &apos;s better than today -- it has no side effects whatsoever .
it &apos;s really easy -- only had 246 genes -- but we were able to synthesize it completely .
we &apos;re not walking around as small organisms alone in the world , but part of a big ecosystem .
the implications can be bad -- if we give ourselves or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the episode of one of us made mistakes .
now i &apos;m mostly here because there &apos;s a kind of buried in the dog training right now that we have on the one side of people who think you &apos;re going to take a dog , first of all by setting up rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just such &quot; strible , &quot; just to beat . and that &apos;s why they get beaten .
no , we do &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- boom , he can try to do it by six to 10 .
they &apos;re like golden retriever .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you might not be .
not just the puppies , but the rest of the family .
these relationship skills are so simple .
their kids are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think working with energy .
because even though i &apos;ve used scientific terms in songs , sometimes it &apos;s very hard to make them lyrically sound .
and even more rare when it &apos;s accompanied by self-awareness and linguistic mastery , like in my case .
one is a white flash of light .
64 multiplied with 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert expanded a mile or two a year .
homo erectus made the same tool over 30 generations .
you can teach them in the lab to practice a little bit of trading , and there &apos;s actually a recurrent process in other animals , but the exchange of an object that never happens to another .
it &apos;s the prosperity of it ; satisfying your needs to save time .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as speccy .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started to get objects around like this far , it was a clue that there was an exchange between groups .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but i &apos;m also because of the connections that people are involved , and the unprecedented possibility of ideas to encounter and to gifted , and i &apos;m sure that the technology is continuing to continue progressing , and therefore the standards of life is going to improve .
this is as high as a 42 story building , and i &apos;ve just added the statue of liberty as compared .
we don &apos;t talk about that , we &apos;re not taking it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they &apos;ve gone .
when we think about the glorious pan-viral neighbor agencies , usually the rapid engineering is the problem , because how can we discover things that are constantly changing ?
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been talking about -- you know this situation , if you don &apos;t get diagnosis in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we sequenced a part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , so far unseen rhinoviruses .
after 10 more days of fieber , she came back -- still a fever -- she has hypoxy -- little oxygen in her lungs .
it wasn &apos;t even sequenced very often .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s totally new . no one has ever seen it before .
a huge battery could do that .
instead , we invent something that fits the cost point of electricity market .
i brought in a liquid metal with low density on the top , a liquid metal with high density down , and melted salt in between .
but david is young , and he wants a ph.d. student , and so he builds -- he builds the first liquid metal battery with this chemical composition .
so what did we learn from all this ?
this was taken in the aquarius underwater lab , six kilometers off the coast of key largo , about 20 meters below the surface of the water .
we quickly realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started interested in maria montessori and her methods , and how she sat them down , and how important she found kids to discover things themselves , and they &apos;re not taught them in an open way .
evolution is often seen as this one of the ways that we chose , but it actually represents a huge number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this all the way to the phase of the space race .
our cities are at risk because many of them are on shore .
there are also stars and so on .
so when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language , what they call social scientists , it &apos;s about language . so we think about communication .
this expression , also known as pride , was studied by jessica tracy , and she showed that looking people and born of blind people doing this when they win a sports competition .
so i thought about it . you hit these people , and you see how they participate . could you get them to pretend it , and would they be involved more ?
what happens in a wheeling change , what happens when it &apos;s taking place at the very small level ? like the following little manipulation , that tiny mixture ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes . where can you really use this ? that was , of course , we care about it .
these things . people sort of show her true . they show themselves .
she was completely down , and here &apos;s what she said : &quot; i don &apos;t have anything to look for . &quot;
you need your body , privacy and two minutes . it can influence the extra way of life at large rate .
lachse swim upstairs to get to their charges , and lebereberegel kapern , gets an ant , crawl your brain , and drive a grass up like a jeep .
and you have to have some kind of car glue , you have to have an answer parat .
so it &apos;s , as i think richard and i think it &apos;s important that these ideas are not going to be abused .
and of course , they are extinct essentially .
but among all of these ideas , thanks to our technology , that are inevitably spreading around the world , many toxic ideas are .
and as with viruses , we shouldn &apos;t try and irrigate them here .
and in my game , it &apos;s called &quot; locking . &quot;
we put some ideas on the legs , we went on tour international .
i know you &apos;re going to tell me , &quot; t doesn &apos;t exist in the music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
no one &apos;s listening to each other . nobody &apos;s trust each other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of cruel revolts .
i don &apos;t want to point out that this should not have happened , but that we need to be better when it comes to answer the questions that you have to consider when you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they work in government agencies . they are drivers .
five dollars can save a life .
she earns about two dollars a day , and she &apos;s building an educational fund , and explaining to me that she &apos;s not going to have married or children before these things are done .
finally , out of despair , they went and consumed a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you will be the best talk you will ever be regret .
okay , the vast majority of us .
and basically , his message was unity , and the connectedness of everything and unity of everything , and his basic value was respect , kindness to strangers .
who &apos;s fighting while he &apos;s walking ?
they start to go , in israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so , more and more people have come , and it has become an income now to support their family .
just move to somebody , with another culture , from another country , with another ethnicity , which is kind of different , and you wrap it into a conversation ; listen to it .
i &apos;m going to start where this story started in central australia in 1985 .
this morning , before they came , who of them had a chance to shower ?
you can see here -- 35 percent of these fewer famous houses where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a functional shower .
21 percent of what we repair is follow manners , things that were actually embedded around .
we &apos;ve done that . he &apos;s got congestion metrics .
we later found that in this region of lung failure , the main cause of diseases and death is the main cause of lung .
one thing is , in context with everything we &apos;ve done , in the mid-&apos; 2000s , nelson mandela didn &apos;t say far from here , &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not natural . it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t care if you call me a lesbian . i don &apos;t really care .
it sounds really disappointed to say that from up here , but if you &apos;re trying to use that , it &apos;s impressive effective .
with that statement , i joined her , believing that children should not leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the youngest federally certified workforce in america with our district mayor in the bronx .
this is a picture of the bronx mayor who empted the children in his house , not in jail , so that they felt belonging .
we gave something back .
if you put big kids together with little kids , they &apos;re the big , thick guy in the middle , which is cool , and they create that accountability under equality that &apos;s incredible .
now you might be wondering about these kids .
keep the kids out of these shops .
stephen ritz : a teacher who founded the south bronx
secondly , if you look here as a layered , i bet even you can see the difference here is an elevation of the st-segment right after this sharp line .
at 10 : 06 , the pig suffered a heart attack .
people with migraine headaches , one aura ahead , have a band with nervous neurons -- here in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute moving to the center of the brain .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine migraines , and we need a treatment . i think we have that now .
my first wish is that the responsive neurostimulator for epilepsy , the rns , for reactive neurostimulator -- a top acronym -- is used for the treatment of other brain disorders .
lawyers take incidents on the provisionary base of hope on the chain of insurgencies that have happened to tell the poor patients full of pity .
a year and a half ago , four out of five of the full-time employed at ushahidi , which , by the way , is to say &quot; produce &quot; -- also ted members .
how do you know what &apos;s actually important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i made it the first time to get it here .
these people below the barrier i call closed , because they &apos;re really excluded from the process of sharing their knowledge with the world .
they intend to use connexions as a platform for developing and educating their educational materials that teach in 84 countries around the world to teach the teachers .
yes , books that might be sold 100 or 1,000 spent a year .
it &apos;s not surprising that everybody likes it , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of pilotprojects are over when people say , &quot; so we &apos;d like to have three or four thousand of them in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a laptop project . it &apos;s an education project .
you can use a few thousand children with two megabit .
so it &apos;s something like an electronic book .
everyone says that &apos;s a $ 100 laptop ; you can &apos;t do that .
and this is the market introduction .
they click around and they &apos;re staring at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a big assembly line , getting out of information , and we can &apos;t keep up with it .
thank you .
i think most people think that hiv positive mother , they always have their child .
that &apos;s not possible . that &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s all going to be good . you &apos;re going to live .
first of all , prevent mother-child transmission .
two years ago , one of the mentors came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better healthcare system ?
the most extraordinary thing is how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of gray substance at the age of four to 22 years , it takes you in childhood what this chart shows . it pops in the early adolescence .
the idea that their father &apos;s singing in the public was enough to accomplish themselves .
this is the gokart that we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the ars electronica museum in austria to install it in its lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say that there stayed online , 24 hours a day for almost nine years .
but the night , as we wrapped up , i asked the tele-actor , like the tele-directors would have decided they would kiss sam donaldson .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working for four generations in the safari business .
quite frankly , i have no idea what it does with the shepherds , but they &apos;re incredibly finful .
the first thing you see about the crocodile &apos;s crocodile is the terrible anger of the bison .
he wraps it around my leg , picks me up again , takes me to a vehicle and can bring me to a doctor .
it was a deep deep inside the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about you . &quot;
we calculated that 200 years are the end of our direct contact with the world .
it &apos;s so simple to see technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect memories such as technology .
she &apos;s the co-founder of my 200-year plan .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you that corn is in all sorts of things .
you should know that in every community , the number of high temperatures already increases significantly .
i led three dives expeditions to antarctica .
but tell me where they are and what country they belong to . &quot;
we &apos;ve also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important place for birds , one of the most amazing places in the pacific .
and we , as the rest of the world , are faced with a problem .
he coined the &quot; reverse fishing license . &quot;
of course , the deep sea areas and the open sea were harassed , but the bulk that everybody wants to look at was in difficulty .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge marine protected areas and huge conservation areas .
now there are several language , instantaneous , automatic translator services accessible over many of our devices , even on smartphones .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there are no conclusions , no one answer to that . but if you &apos;re a computer geek like me , you say , &quot; well , what do you tell us that data ? &quot;
instead , he has documented very carefully , whatever happens over and over , when technology seems to be in an environment for the first time and in a community .
so there are , of course , two different possibilities .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves kline painting .
i mean , it was at least how i was happy .
now , of course , there was a question that was going around me for a while : well , can i do more of the things i like to do in design , and less of those i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here it is from the front .
they &apos;re faced with a terrible situation without exit .
they &apos;re disadvanted in hospitals .
as a 15-year-old , for example , i was considered to be extremely gifted in multiplications , because i knew how to use the mulitplictionist , and i know how to use logarithmen , and i can quickly work with the calculator .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in so many of my friends , who in their &apos; 60s , &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s and &apos; 90s are still active as being a lawyer , farmers , jerists and doctors .
when christian iconography was made and made of krufixes swastikas , young jewish men in the united states and canada batman and superman , who also turned back to the bible .
the case of granada , the last muslim envalve , europe .
the biggest evil , rughal , does not want these stones to update , so he &apos;s trying to stop them from updates .
and one of my favorites is al-batina from yemen .
&quot; and when does the article come out ? &quot;
rughal : there must be something we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous if a group is identified to itself as extremely identified .
naif al-mutawa : the islam refugeted superheroes
let &apos;s take a look .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing it , i discovered something odd about myself .
so they have the eye , and then the concepts come in .
but of course , china also has a tremendous number of people .
but what this shows is that this kind of visualization of information is a form of knowledge primition .
it &apos;s actually a pleasure to deal with them , because they &apos;re visual .
the eden head note is named after the eden project in the u.k.
why don &apos;t it smell like potato or veilchen ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows you to work less .
now after a couple of months of search , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule called borane , and that &apos;s exactly the same vibration .
this is the foundation for the device that these two people have built by ford .
they made it -- and it did just like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
there are a number of things that i want to point out at the moment that i want to pay attention to .
and she actually had no idea of the context that she had landed in .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say goodbye , neither my mother , nor my father , not my sister , my brother , my aunt , my uncle , my cousins , my grandparents , nobody .
i reported this . i covered just to say that i had two things when i left the orphanage that i wanted to do , which was find my family , and the other was to write poems .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us is walking around and finds little parts .
he had a scoliose , and he must have been therefore penible of other , female and probably much smaller family members of his age 12 .
is that a good evolutionary adaptation , or will it lead us to be the hominid species that exists the shortest thing on planet earth ?
but are we going to do that , or are we going to let nature take their course ?
one day , a couple of weeks or maybe a year later , i was with my baby in a shop for artistic needs . i wanted to buy auditorium -- we had planned a bastle day .
that meant a fundamental change for me .
my tipp : about 70 layers of this , matt-black automobile diversion .
do you want to know how i really am ? this project is just for me , and yet i &apos;ve gone so far to buy a chinese newspaper in 1941 in san francisco to put the bird in reasonable ways ...
when we started to the path to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect sday : sunshine , the smell of eukalyptus and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to walk again , it &apos;s just a gear . &quot;
i remember my father pushed me out in the wheelchair , and i was poisoned from up to bottom and feeling the sun for the first time on my face .
they told me , &quot; we &apos;re going to put you next to them , because we think that &apos;s good for them . &quot;
she would take me the phone book , and i would call the airschool , i &apos;d book , and i &apos;d book it and i &apos;d say i &apos;d like to hear a piece of lump for a flight hour .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and mom and daddy ? never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i work in a very instinctive way .
it &apos;s like an anish kapoor flying through a richard serra .
how the hell should i do a phone in three weeks , if i have these things that have evolved over millions of years ?
each of these elements could be dependent on the wall as a kind of artistic object .
in his days , he was the highest taxpayer in british .
i look at individual surface structures and how they flow -- how they stretch and flow . it &apos;s based on typologic , but that &apos;s not the endmotivation . it &apos;s made from aluminum , as opposed to aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a water droplet .
if you think about it besides contemporary architecture , it feels completely natural to me .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made out of kevlar .
soon after i &apos;d done my dr. , i was fortunate to be a member of a research group that used him for the first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of these rippie jellyfish .
it uses red bioluminescence like a shopkeeper for an infrared television to blow up to the animals that are blind for red light , and can see you without being seen .
so they use it to find food and partners .
i urge you to call me a different science that still uses hundreds of years of old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i set out to rediscover the value of sleep .
and on june 5th , 1995 , i heard a loud bang on the disk that changed my life and ended up being a duck .
and here are the ducks again .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the influence of glass buildings on the lives of birds .
so , for example , if i do something like this -- this is the clay for purple .
depending on how i correct it , i can hear music with food and composing it .
one of them is &quot; i have a dream &quot; by martin luther king , and the other one is by hitler .
right now , you can see more and more frequently that ex-legal advisers are now the main ceo .
you don &apos;t want to say anything wrong that could be used against you . &quot;
absolutely irrelevant .
and what happens if teachers want to fix order ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t they trust the law ?
because it &apos;s such that freedom has a formal structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest and greatest change : we have to remove the authority of disposal and application of law to judge and officials .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise she will soon suffer complete still .
put boundaries for the zines that can calculate credit card companies , and for the fees you can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to measure round columns with a ruler .
he had a very badly paid job .
he had only a toy gun at the end .
but the problem of rely on rules and incentives is that they demoralize the job , and they demoralize the vocational activity in two different ways .
so smart law is better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any smart law can sustain this unlimited time .
why did this idea spread ?
people want to be virtuous .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to take the mentality a little bit closer , which we -- america and the rest of the world -- back then .
this was bert , the turtle .
we have to do it here with a complete reality loss .
what i want to show you is what they needed to transport 34 lbs up to the most sophisticated uranium . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
what if they had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and we bring the trusts you just saw , somewhere in the financial neighborhood .
part of the problem is that disaster planners themselves are overwhelmed by the idea of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me by somebody who &apos;s a kenner of civil defense , and that &apos;s the fact that america had a hard time .
there are lots of black sheep out there doing the wrong things , and the problems have even veiled .
we can show our results . we can do things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s retirement to have a dangerous workenvironment .
imagine if we could , because if we could , we could do more .
the governments that make most progress are the governments that have found the ways to enable shared value in business , rather than seeing the government the actors who have made it .
maybe i can cut here , look at the brain , and i can change my slides .
i want to zoom in .
come with me a moment to the 19th century , right to june 24th , 1833 .
we could certainly all be so productive if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us as much time .
they were instantly assessing the british government to get money to build babbage &apos;s machines , because they believed that these machines would have tremendous practical effects for society .
and not only did these formerly affordable men get the research , but they also proved to look at the wasteer edge instead of just answering the under-defined questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned about life .
once you start looking at the very small stuff -- this person wrote a whole article and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and everyone that &apos;s not old enough , you have no idea how this infection happened -- which is through these disks .
there are about 10,000 programs that have been defeated .
this would be the frequency in which you can find each of the 26 letters of the alphabets in one of randomly chosen ape text .
wherever life is , you will have this distribution , as opposed to this distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the cop says , &quot; are you sure ? hey buddy , are you sure you lost this one ? &quot;
this is the data from a single survey for immunization rate in a single district in zambia , from a few years ago that i worked on .
as you can see , bruce willis had a lot more hair at the time .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had the time , or i fit it in my plan , and i wasn &apos;t in vacation .
instead of teaching people how to package the forms on mobile phones , we should develop a piece of software that enables them to do it themselves without practice and without my own .
that &apos;s less than i earned at the time when i went to the consultants for two weeks .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or in the balloon , we have to change the height .
that can be in spirituality .
and that &apos;s why you need meteorologists .
i promised that the next time i was going to fly around the world , i &apos;m not going to take fuel , regardless of fossil energy , to be safe , not to be threatened by the tancan .
i think you need a pilot in the airplane that can talk to the universities that can talk to students , can talk to politicians during the flight , and can really make it a human adventure .
so what is the goal ?
that &apos;s why all of the people who believe in this mental stance are willing to be part of this team .
now you just need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing that i want to create is clarity , which is what this problem is and what it isn &apos;t .
this is crazy , really , when you think about it .
let &apos;s stop for a second with nonsense .
the fact is that we can see the first generation of this disease and this extreme poverty in the eyes , you see about the ocean , say it and you think it is . we don &apos;t have to stand for it .
it &apos;s on nerves .
this year , a test for us , especially for the leaders of g8 states who have entered and looked at the world history .
people figure that out slowly .
and with this campaign as our screen , my organization , data , and other groups have the energy and the enthusiasm that &apos;s out there from hollywood to the back of america .
step forward , a nurse , a teacher , a housewife , and life is saved .
the idea that the internet that changed all of their lives can change a country -- and a continent that just made it so analog , let alone digital -- verify my head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
now your job is to recognize which of these forms is bouba and which kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not even a prison warter , that sentence is , literally , wrong .
when we solve a problem or discover something new , we &apos;re comparing what we already know with what &apos;s unknown to us .
nadia al-sakkaf : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit on all of these representations themselves .
pm : i don &apos;t think so .
how did you deal with that , personally , but also your collaborators ?
some of my reporters have been arrested .
this clearly shows a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three and a half times too big .
this is a list of side effects : if you &apos;re eating too much salt , like a zero butter and melting sandwich , you &apos;re probably going to get to the intensive care .
but soon i showed symptoms for legal heart failure , and i had to go back to sea level , knowing that i would probably never see my home again .
i was sitting there talking a little bit about the transplant , and i asked him what if i needed a transplant to do to prepare me .
i was hanging on a dozen machines that kept me alive .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these birth damage also happened in the united states by 200 percent .
and also , what &apos;s interesting is that the same business that &apos;s selling us the 80 million pounds of atrazine , the breast cancer promotion , is also sold the antidote today -- a company and the same company .
we also started off as water organisms .
what would our unborn children say to us , if they were once again a day again , today i had a little bit of octylacine phenol , some artificial mosnuts , and a little bit of phenol a.
the problem is that in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , you don &apos;t see that connection .
this is the accumulation of the biona creek next to the los angeles airport .
i bot five cents for each passenger .
the throwaway society cannot be twisted , it has become global .
here you see , in red , the prevalence of the coastal tree tree .
they &apos;re like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant , and the biggest part of them remains hidden .
she looks out of her hanging mat and aviist comes from all directions around us .
redwoods have a huge surface that &apos;s expanding in the sky , because they tend to have something called reiteration -- repetition .
streaming deceives the canopy stability , just like a cathedral , and helping the tree live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely heartbreaking to see this .
but recently all the doors of the palastes have been ripped open and break the walls .
this was 25 years ago .
so , for example , let &apos;s look at the centipede virus first .
so how do these people do money with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to watch how we work -- how security people work -- and try to figure out a way of dealing with the safety currencies that we meet .
you &apos;ll find that you can see an internetadaddress down there : unionseek.com / io.exe , and if you open this image file on your computer , that program is downloaded and performed .
and if you look at the images of the scene , you can see that the mark of the mercedes o600ko78rus is .
we have to find some way to ensure that everything &apos;s going on , even though the computers are falling out .
but i have nothing to do with that .
this person is surrounded with consultants .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
what does his future look like ?
these powers completely disappear , nobody underpins that by 2011 .
it would be good if people got more attention , and take this kind of computation seriously and participate in it , because that would change things , but it would change things in two biased ways .
what that means is that we recognize a copy itself , when it &apos;s used only one part of the original file , it &apos;s in slow motion and it &apos;s got a worse image and sound quality .
and the happy couple , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their wedding journey and saw that their video had suddenly spread like a louder .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go to the distance .
that &apos;s what he was taught to do since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like mau who taught me how to navigate .
what is it that drives you in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you dreamt and make it happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right guy . didn &apos;t have ...
in that moment , consciously or unconsciously , right now that you &apos;re deciding to focus on something , you can adjust to what it means , and whatever it means , it makes emotion .
you &apos;ve ever done anything , and then you &apos;ve gone , &quot; that &apos;s me ! &quot;
to death , anxiety . so , god in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it by intimacy , by kindness , by prayer , by wandering in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t walk through them because i &apos;m through . the last element is a feeling .
jewish man with family in the occupied area , somebody in new york , who would have died if he &apos;d been to work on the day , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist , and he clearly said it .
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools that a large number of people can tell their stories , people around the world .
the color of the particles corresponds to the type of feeling -- happy , positive sentiments have bright colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i &apos;ve been on the computer all day . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts walking , and there are thousands of feelings that have been collected .
the 10 themes are punishing out and circling the time capsule .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click on the click and see this iconic image of betty ford kissing her husband &apos;s sarg .
you can also look at quotes if you want to read quotes to climate change .
so people find clouds as something that stands in the paths .
they &apos;ve started to live . today , tens of thousands of members of nearly 100 countries around the world .
you just need to take a step outside , and look at this , which is so common , so commonly so banal that everybody else can overlook it .
so look up , admire the short-lived beauty , and keep thinking about carrying your head in the clouds .
they would have added 25,000 images , and they would have done this : &quot; 25,000 , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the funding money to buy my first graphic computer . it was a huge machine .
these footage comes from a virtual autopsy .
here you can see the knife being penetrated into the heart .
it &apos;s a little mechanical pencil that &apos;s built in its internal very , very fast stepper motors .
now this is a really interesting project .
so he does it .
so , very gifted people .
i went out with the children as often as possible to connect the academic fabric with the real world .
it &apos;s not all yet , but it &apos;s an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about the foundations of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into detail why we imagine the universe like this , but there &apos;s a math and it &apos;s trying to explain the physics that we know .
but in the course of my career , something was going on in me .
in 2001 , i visited it during a research board .
we got a lot of applications .
this is what it was after the first graduation in 2004 .
he &apos;s just graduated from graduate school , and he was just filmed with somebody you &apos;ve all seen .
each one is going to have a pan-african student , but it &apos;s specialized in different disciplines .
i got my first computer as a teenager in accra , and it was a really great device .
he &apos;s exploring the brain using mri , and he &apos;s saying this is the most beautiful brain he &apos;s ever scanned .
so for the next few slides , i &apos;ll give you a little bit about that .
transistors are getting smaller to enable that , and this has made our technology far better .
our retina chip is behind these lens here .
i had such a gut feeling that we &apos;re going wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so now we know what is a schwarzschild radius .
i like to call them the prime thunders of the galaxy , because they &apos;re kind of offered .
so in our galaxy , we can see more detail than anywhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff in there .
it pulls a lot more than the other side , and the cloud gets ripped apart .
and i hope that at least i &apos;ve convinced you that we have to have a really supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
one day i was out in the streets of new york , and i saw some children playing between stairs , cars and hydrant baseball .
so , for example , people liked the 11th century pieces that ended .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , for example , the big &quot; what &quot; was to praise god and prize for the first eight centuries .
through new and enhanced instruments , the age of virtuoes began to collapse .
but one question remains : what happens when the music stops ?
michael tilson thomas : music and feelings over time
so we are at the dawn of a new age of age .
by 1945 , they took it to 100,000 a year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about music composition , although i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but more recently , my interest has been viewed by a new view of great human mass , because there are circumstances where they can make something really cool .
well , i think this is the most recent development of a phenomenon that we call mass accelerated innovation .
but the element of desire is really the most important thing .
we get jugglers back from them .
let me introduce you to this point sam haber .
but even when you shine the screen , there &apos;s a lot more over-mediated than just words there .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
how web videos foster global innovations .
one , i have to have a service speaker to the audience , and talk about what i &apos;m going to give him , rather than saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and that you &apos;re going to be having fun designing your own ultimate or worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare it to each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugar , such a kind of behavioral simps that we call superpower .
these kinds of tests are going to increase this , ok ?
somebody said , &quot; why ? &quot;
he thought he could reverse the waves . he couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three big changes in transparency , division and accountability where people have really power .
how do we do that ?
my bridge coach , sharon osberg claims , all around the world there are more photos of their head than any other .
11 out of 14 countries .
and secondly , participating teachers would look at video records and questionnaires as a helpful diagnostic tool , because they &apos;re useful in specific areas of reactions in which perform is meaningful .
so i wish everyone a nice weekend .
reading and writing dna becomes easier and cheaper and cheaper .
biohacker works alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a biolab ? &quot;
if you have these surveys around the world , this can lead to a change in perspective , who &apos;s going to be allowed to do biotechnology .
the kingdom argues that his laws allow him to confuse or dismiss strangers that represent economic risk or security risk or risk for health care or moral ideas of the state .
these laws are a beat in the face of science and prejudice and ignorance and prescription of traditions and selective religious mindset .
why do you get pregnant if you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one out of 10 hiv neuinfections affects people who inject drugs .
so social workers , the condoms of vulnerable populations , are not even tracked by the police , are scolded or randomly imprisoned .
here , children were born , people died there .
office buildings for personal work are already obsolete .
they &apos;ve removed the high line , conquering the road , the flow below the road , and you come from one end of the seoul to the other , without crossing the road .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
jobs should be shared as well .
their livers are literally regarded oil .
and they killed about 12,000 sharks at that time by actually just putting a hanfrope out of the land &apos;s tongue in keem bay on achill island .
we know very little about them .
so this tag figures out the place of a shark depending on the time and the sun , the temperature and the depth of the water .
let &apos;s look at the nucleotide , this has something to do with the genes passed by the parents , we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , have a factor of 10 diversity less than other haids .
so , les refined this research and found that the size is about 9,000 .
and what was okay . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought to myself , &quot; hey , i can build on this . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark before we take a sample , we can tell the geneticists whether it was by a male or a female .
so i decided to give myself the handler .
their bodies are decomposed with machetes , and they &apos;re supposed to be used for some magic trank to make money -- people tell themselves a lot of these stories .
no business done with nobody .
my journalism may not adapt to other continents or other countries , but in my part of africa , it works . it &apos;s about corruption , people immediately ask , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the epicenter of punkmusic .
i wouldn &apos;t have gone through as transsexuals .
and have these people ever realized that they had made a victim of their discrimination ?
today , in 29 states , in more than half the country because of its sexuality being regulated .
at some point i realized that my mission was to photograph &quot; gay &quot; in a miserable one , because there was a million different shades of gay .
at least i hope it &apos;s going to be harder to recognize your human rights .
one : the world is , and will always contain good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the human .
and third , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that the soldiers had taken .
in three ways , the prevailing type is called exhibition .
this is stanley milgram , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust happen here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my gentleman , who &apos;s responsible if something happens to him ? &quot;
stanley milgram , and by the way , both did the high school in the 1954 , at the james monroe in the bronx .
here are the wardens with the symbols of power and anonymity .
dehumanization of the other . unindividualization of self .
alexander solschenitsyn says that the border between good and evil is lost by the heart of any human being .
and i set up the experiment the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what anybody could do , &quot; no big deal to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s a puzzle that was really elusive .
we have one self .
but on my left retina is a delle marked through the red arrow .
there &apos;s just one reference point , which is the body .
i promise that i &apos;m not saying anything , except that it &apos;s supposed to scare you .
and the autobiographical self has solved extended memory , thinking , creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for the hip hop -- and anita hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m telling you about it and risking to make me ridiculously , because i think feminism has partly the task of admitting the aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a hero .
you can now tell me , i didn &apos;t set myself on fire .
she talked about yields , she started peacekeepers , she organized communities , she used friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .
i mean , it &apos;s this self-perceptions that distinguishes homo sapiens from earlier human forms .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves reading the electrical activity in my brain while i &apos;m giving this talk .
we brought lots of prototypes and products to life that you can control with thoughts , like thought-controlled appliances , or a floating chair .
the headset is wirelessly linked to an ipad or smartphone .
how these children can utilize their new awareness of their better , many of the harmful and widespread social stigmata will surround people that are diagnosed as different , facing them .
it understood the power of human narrative , and the value that we divide to people changes and evolves and grows .
and he said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibilities .
largely , and unexpected , put them up .
this specialist didn &apos;t stop studying my eyes .
i was walking a distance i know well .
and it happened very , very slowly .
i didn &apos;t really believe in myself , not really , not to all the parts of me , all the little ichs in all of us .
that &apos;s me . that &apos;s my whole .
what we have is the same thing , the same thing , the same activity , but one of them feels great , and in the other , with only one small change in the posture , they feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s a different debate that has to take place , which is about the level of control that we have over our tax money .
for 0.01 percent of that money , you could have installed wifi in the trains , which would not have reduced the duration of the journey , but what would have made the pleasure and the selfishness far more would have improved .
i don &apos;t lend to the complete front of one over the other .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is understood as a prior discipline to human psychology .
would the average answer in 50 to 60 percent .
it &apos;s going to allow them to not be themselves , nor to hurt others .
jehu !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i have a coin with my head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our shell of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had sufficient , we actually have very strong effects in children around the world , and now people of all ages .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , who wants to live forever .
hello . my name is dan ellsey . i &apos;m 34 years old , and i have cerebral parese .
this is actually the score of dans &apos;s piece that he composed completely in hyperscore .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a subject .
there &apos;s the present self first .
i have to write five pages a day for articles , or i had to give up five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you , the last behavioral time machine , is something i put together with hal hershfield , which was introduced to me from my fellow at a previous project , bill sharpe .
it &apos;s pretty good that it doesn &apos;t affect people about that , because if one of the faces smile , the other face will look like finster .
this is one of the reasons that so much of what we think of western science , math and construction art was actually developed in the first few centuries of our time representation of the persians , arabs and doors .
x is the unknown , because there &apos;s no &quot; sh &quot; in the spanish .
so it &apos;s not surprising that if you talk to affected mental illnesses , you &apos;re probably going to hear stories of hidden suffering , shame and discrimination in almost all walks of life .
a little over 30 years ago , the nations of the world gathered together in alma-ata and gave off this legendary explanation .
what is it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve already heard about the fish .
if you look at these wins , you can see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually subsidies .
this was in the early 2000s when india wanted to power his bip growth -- as a means for the recovery -- to china with its rapid growth of eight , nine , 10 percent , and wondered , why can we not ?
that doesn &apos;t put them in any happier , but they have the confidence and the courage to step forward and say , &quot; we &apos;ve calculated that .
green carbon , which is emissions from deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon together 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved winning .
i didn &apos;t know what these things meant , although dick did not -- sydney , by the way .
i also liked these intellectual machogames .
and he said he had basically the same relationship with his father .
there was a theory .
he did it back in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole vinyl , and the zolatone color , which was just covered by these fabulous aluminum shell .
a lot of these ideas went into the produced trailers for airstream .
if you think about sending your children to the tinkering school , you &apos;re going to come back with prellations , scratches and bloodlines .
but let them play around with their own conditions and trust me , they &apos;re going to learn what they can &apos;t learn from dora the discoverer .
so next time you want to throw a device away , you don &apos;t .
i think it &apos;s all . that &apos;s number five enemies . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here &apos;s my wife walking , four months after , in aspen , and in good constitution .
how about a perfectly bionic knee replacement , not just sharing ?
this is one of the seven remaining sputniks that have not been shot in space .
and so in the years , in 1455 , very western europe started to buy printing , at first thousands , then hundreds of thousands , and finally millions of individuals to print little inch in the middle of the hell should be in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
when edison invented the light bulb , it looked something like this .
you have to be quite smart , and even though i haven &apos;t graduated from high school , it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid these days and get it in the world .
they literally put us in the door .
if you listen to the stereo in your position , both ears listen to loudspeakers .
we have the problem that the antenna vibrates .
thank you so much again .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and set places .
recently , i &apos;ve created some rather sophisticated arounds of droughts of sophisticated noodles .
and i drew her own special map for every person , and i wrote her name on it , taped her and sent her .
i &apos;m sure i can see you make the tubes .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s worth dying , my valuable and limited time of life on this earth is actually accomplishing it .
in this mode , he &apos;s trying to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
let &apos;s just think of future technologies . we start at the beginning of the world .
and when you bend it , you see the amino acids with the ph-values where they have different charges .
and through a sequence of selection evolution , you can fish one out of a billion , which is what you want to do , like , make a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see oxygen bubbles coming out .
when you ask people the question : where do they go when they have something important to do ?
i was sitting on my desk using my expensive computer .
and then what happens -- sometimes you have these days where you wake up at eight in the morning , or at seven or when you just stand up , and you say , you know , man , i didn &apos;t sleep well .
in the office , most of the interruptions and distractions that people actually stop from work are unrandomly .
we all know that &apos;s true . they would never experience a spontaneous meeting , that of employees will occur .
so meetings and managers are the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , once a week , the afternoon , nobody can talk about .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to do this for seven years now , and i have no idea what the future will look like .
but when you ask people about the three most important things they &apos;re carrying -- -- no matter what culture , which gender and what context -- most people say : key , money , and if you have one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big , but we have the tendency to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
you take 10 or 20 percent provision , and then -- the owner of the store takes 10 or 20 percent provision , and then you keep the rest of my family in bar to my family .
it demands the norm .
and he kind of has a recognition for the values of livestrong .
at the same time with the spread of these mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our current reality is less interesting than the story that we &apos;ll talk about later .
what were we talking about ?
dean ornish shares with us new findings of research that show how the positive habits of life can influence a human on genetic level . he says , for example , if we eat healthier , eat better , sports and love more , our brain cells are actually carving .
until i tell you who said it .
within that framework , we can clearly feel regret about many different things .
when i went home that night after i got my tattoo , i stayed up almost all night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; answer to all &quot; regret can let us go back in jellyfish for days .
and as i used to say , i &apos;m a perfect ctionist .
i thought , in preparation for my ted wish , i would try to perform what i &apos;m trying to do , and how to fit what they &apos;re trying to do .
not in india . now there are at least half a million active there .
and it occurred to me that somebody in this nongovernmental world must think about the organization of the collective markets .
and so we got to do that .
listen to this : less than four tens of one percent of those who were treated , stop the revenue of their medication or neglected in a way that might be treated .
it &apos;s worth one trial , and i think it would be successful .
the pulses are not computational .
if the turbine is used , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people will bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , to green school .
domestic women from bali cooking cooking food on wheel-fuel fuel , and they use secrets that only know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who &apos;s coming and studying this .
green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , cookie and balances were still healthy and uncommissioned . &quot;
and then apple alex put out the best voice i &apos;d heard for so long .
there was one reason : that was me .
the linguistics are not natural .
but that &apos;s not the point .
at first , the internet was a helpful tool for me , and now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m making for my real , everyday life .
it &apos;s human to ignore disease .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing test .
before i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what do you live about ? &quot;
we treated two compelling pages as a single page , because that &apos;s what the readers are doing .
so what &apos;s the lesson behind that ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re talking about it .
it was ashamed and terrible things happened to me .
all of them lost hope in my cure .
so they went to their storage rooms and all of them collected their overwhelming furniture -- they gave me pots and piles , begging , everything .
you don &apos;t know how far away that road is , and you don &apos;t know if you go straight and you hear cars flip over and over , and you had a terrible accident that you put in that position .
i thought , for some reason , time remains , and only for family and friends had moved on .
for example , understanding molecular structures .
he took me to the temple of nikko .
can we argue that we would have discovered all the symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it around because i &apos;ve put a little barrier in it , right ?
if i run a magical train and then one more , it creates a third one .
galois has set up a series of laws for how these tables are interacting , these symmetries .
this sort of symmetry is what we call six to 3-3 .
instead of all shouting through , i want to know how many digits are the number . ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects , basically -- please spell it for me .
one : poor nutrition , maybe shorter lifespan .
thomas edison would have felt very well in a software company today .
penicillin was discovered in 1928 , but even in 1940 , there were no commercial and medical amounts of it .
it was the origin of xerox-copying , who had his 50th birthday last year .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos is now happening . let &apos;s make the best of it .
it works on every computer and browser . minus , minus , minus and the text gets smaller .
you don &apos;t need to delete that extra too .
and therefore , a kind of information source , which i &apos;m inspired by , is my real desk .
a means , on the other hand , would be like a rastering order , so you can get the more traditional desktop again , and things are laid out on grids .
now , with my music , i reach the hearts of people , and there are no more frontiers .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphors with biss . and with such a bite , i want to suggest today that we rethink the role of contemporary mathematics a little bit -- not just financial mathematics , but in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there are 2,000 physicists on wall street today , and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flies that you might have beaten up on amazon .
these are not financial data ; that &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
here we go . shake . louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , intersections without traffic lights , so with stop signs , save many lives , but there &apos;s an excessive multiplexing of them .
and the answer is to allow cars to come safely from this side of the street .
warren buffet had recommended that , frankly , what works and what doesn &apos;t work and what to do to an annual cause .
in fact , we see at the genetic code that it &apos;s the only known disease that &apos;s ever known in africa , many people have actually trained many things to escape the mothersquito .
what this means is that the economy is actually stuck in this area , because it just prevents so much .
but that just doesn &apos;t give us a trade plan .
not only was she weak ; she gets weaker .
one teacher at the top quartile is going to increase the performance of his class -- measured by 10 percent in a year .
but there &apos;s no relationship to being a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and these free courses could not only be available on the internet , but you can also make dvds everywhere , so that everybody with access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers .
conventional vessels , like this cup , they need eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought he was a young artist , he was a painter , and he lived in florence after his graduate .
when i look at these pictures , i &apos;m going to smell my smoke again on my clothes when i was going home at my family night .
my parents responded great . they said , &quot; we know you &apos;re frightened , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to hold us so powerful ?
this is mass general in boston .
the pathologist takes the sample , freezes it , cuts it , cut it , looked at it under the microscope and inform the operating room .
so in this collection , there &apos;s a solution enriched with these three-side molecules , along with a color here , green , injected into the veins of a cancer patient , normal tissue can &apos;t separate these molecules .
with colored lymph nodes , as part of our treatment options today , the surgeon is looking for the individual node , the lymph node , where the cancer starts .
when nerves are damaged , they can cause paralysis , and pain .
if we take these two samples together .
we know that this is feasible , and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousand different types of cell that we &apos;re learning from .
it will affect the healthy circuits in the same way that the sick you want to repair .
and one morning in the summer of 2004 , we tried to do it , and it would work for the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that it &apos;s already a short activation of these cells to power learning .
and it &apos;s going on . now .
i want to end with a story that we think might find a clinical application .
now you can see that the animal actually mics the walls and goes to the little platform and can use its eyes again .
buildings are colonized with the air found microbes coming in through the window and mechanical ventilation systems .
and if you stop out , the air contains microbes that are generally associated with plant leaves and dirt .
obviously , i &apos;m a physically very strong person , as you can see , so i didn &apos;t worry to carry this thing 20 blocks .
the same is true for the question , who , after 9 / 11 , kept the streets alive in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of the things i &apos;ve experimented with is something called google share , and basically you just take an abstract term and you look at google afterwards , and then you &apos;re looking for it in these results by somebody &apos;s name .
this is britney spears . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , most of them will link .
what was normal for all of us 40 years ago -- telling stories between generations -- is now rare .
in 1939 , the film is older than most of our members of our members .
was the story well telling ?
why don &apos;t we honorize to see the same passion as reading ?
they &apos;re shipped in california with a warning clue : &quot; this product contains chemicals that are seen from the state of california as the fabric of cancer , birth defects and other reproductive damage . &quot;
so maybe we could develop a change strategy that needs humility , and for my job as an architect , it &apos;s an unfortunate that words &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; since &quot; the eternal quell &quot; have not been mentioned in the same sentence .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone age did not end because the stones came out . &quot;
and this can be totally o.k. for berlin , but we &apos;re building owners in houston , and all the windows are closed , and with all the products that were obviously not used for indoor spaces , which is actually a vertical gas chamber .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you will use it .
since then , we &apos;ve taken the 4,000 most common industrial chemicals in a database that we &apos;re going to provide in six weeks of the public .
now we &apos;ve learned 160 lbs of heavy mechanicians learning the avian on the internet .
we started to integrate commercial and mixed use of buildings so that all people have centers and places where they can stay .
and this is the infamous nsa-data center in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . don &apos;t let anybody tell you that we knew all this because we didn &apos;t know it .
for example , they admit that the data collection at microsoft , on 9 / 11 , started at yahoo on march 12th 2008 , and then the other one : google , facebook , skype , apple and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden has similar laws like the united states .
and whoever tells you , he didn &apos;t think much about it for a long time .
their email has been read , and she talked in the u.n. headquarters and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right to privacy , there can &apos;t be real freedom of speech , and therefore no effective democracy can be made . &quot;
a lot of people , when you see a fresh human brain for the first time , say , &quot; usually it looks different when you get a brain shown . &quot;
all of these empty areas , are the areas where the pipes go through .
and the nature of a particular cell , to drive its underlying biochemistry , is by determining which one of the 25,000 genes is turned on and what threshold they are turned on .
now experts are coming into play , making basic anatomical contributions .
we take the tagging material , we put it on a so-called gene chip .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they &apos;re looking at their genomes , and they &apos;re trying to find activate herds that are fundamentally linked to the genes .
whether this depends on the individual genetic background or their experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how to eradicate poverty , we just have to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s some more questions .
how can you know ?
so what &apos;s the problem ?
well , before that , everything was the same .
and there have been a lot of experiments that all came to the same outcome , which is why i &apos;m just going to tell you about one .
so what &apos;s the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it , and we need to steer the politics .
and maybe we &apos;re going to start small , things where we &apos;re sure they work .
harnessing poverty is more courageous than a scientific work and a lack of data on the effects of aid , the question of how to extend it . but clark medal winner esther duflo thinks it &apos;s possible to figure out what development measures and what damage -- to randomides .
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way , in circulation .
and the legend reports that alexander went through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with over 1,000 languages , and it wouldn &apos;t move . &quot;
so we look at the countries , and the specific materials and the data .
i want to talk about this from the perspective of capital markets .
in tanzania last week , the standard of east african biogenerables was started to live in .
if i had to ask you , &quot; what was the stock market in 2005 with the world &apos;s best achievement ? &quot; would you think about egypt ?
because there are fascinating possibilities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey we all want to be inspired to be inspired and to feel one with the universe that celebrates life .
you put a switch on -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought that .
i &apos;m going to let this run so you can kind of pick this up , and i &apos;m going to describe my reactions when i first saw this .
that &apos;s exactly .
ok , change , raise your right hand .
kt : yes .
kt : no , no . i &apos;m just seeing the road .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
go away again .
kb : how many times did you feel that ?
let &apos;s close your eyes in five , four , three , two , one .
it &apos;s only when you want the pressure released , you make a reverse movement , but only if you want the pressure to be released .
do you want to try it ?
you &apos;re going to have a certain sense of sensation , and if you feel the sensation , i want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle .
there &apos;s one more thing i &apos;d like to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , like that , in danger .
kb : ok . do you think it &apos;s here , yes or no ?
so , first of all , keith barry shows us how our brain can manipulate our body -- with a trick that also works by podcast , and then he refers the audience into some breathtaking art offs of the brain .
i set up .
this is not for the &quot; one of four . &quot; that &apos;s for all four .
i saw that both religious and non-religious people are equally obsessed with morality .
the base line is almost zero if there &apos;s no stimulus to shake .
and then you get the message from the computer : &quot; person 1 sent them a lot of money .
we showed that oxytocin increases the generosity in one-page transfers by 80 percent .
i just found the molecule .
he asked me again , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
in experiments , we &apos;ve given men testosterone .
this tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with this new few emotionally .
and it &apos;s very easy to ramp a brain to oxytocin .
in order to make the device work , you need a lot , a lot of people .
or should you not do that ?
and they answered quite genervat : &quot; you &apos;ve given us a device that works only in english , so we &apos;ve taught ourselves english so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making an absurde statement .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
how will this be tomorrow ?
we have to reverse this imbalance , to forget about threat .
i think that &apos;s where gravity is .
i asked incredible questions -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how are you going to end ? &quot; -- nine years old .
and just one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i just lost the thread .
shivdutt went to the local catasteramt in uttar pradesh , and found that he was dedicated to the official facilities as passed away .
that &apos;s why this area is unordered .
polygamy is in the privileged layer that is able to pay multiple paths and lead multiple households .
after these four children , you see zumras young sister , who follow her children who were killed too .
and finally , there was a single person sitting in the back of me , and later his participation , so i had to freak him up so he was unknown .
at 16 , the children have to leave the orphanage , although they can &apos;t go anywhere .
one of the interesting things , of course , is the combination of the naked hand at the instrument and the technology , and of course , what he said about listening to our young people .
now , my career could continue a little bit longer !
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
and the sound comes out of it with the resonating body .
or we do this and we think that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
and one of them has a tail . but then why can &apos;t i do that if i study a piece of music ?
in this sticking demonstration ward , the pigeon shows percussionistin evelyn glennie why listening of music involves much more than making sound waves meet for its eardrum .
and it became so big , until the point where there was a truck last year at macy &apos;s thanksgiving parade jumping out rick astley and saying , &quot; rickrolled , &quot; millions of people on television .
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing about it .
cp : you &apos;re lucky that it &apos;s not being transmitted to them live .
peace and love were mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what to hold it .
this is 10 times longer than the mammals needed to reach their maximum body size and to conquer all of these habitats .
we &apos;re very similar to dinosaurs , and we &apos;re unusual in our two-legged attitudes to life .
basically , it &apos;s a country that didn &apos;t have a container traffic at the beginning of our work .
this is an adult orinoko-crocodile in his jaw .
paul has never seen a fossil like this before .
these are all animals . there are a set of possibilities .
i became an artist , and i started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;ve been engaging with this question for centuries -- how do you involve these children in science ?
but bad news for derartu tulu -- some other runners had the same idea , including the olympic gold medal winners and paula radcliffe , which is an enormously , with the fastest marathon lizer ever .
show me an animal with glacious and pine , then it has something to do with water .
we didn &apos;t use our physical strength because we &apos;re the largest metrics in the jungle .
well , emily baer -- one of 500 runners and runners -- they end to the eighth place , under the best 10 , even though they &apos;ve performed on all the aid stations to still while running their baby -- and denoch 42 quit .
that &apos;s all we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
stop putting the focus on these city-marathons where you failed when you need four hours .
in robotic technology , it was always about interacting with things , not with people -- certainly not in a social way that , of course , would help people to accept robots as part of our daily lives .
the cookie monster is very , very bad .
the remote-projector was an experimentator from our group where they used three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can become the active participants in your grandchildren &apos;s lives , in a way that it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third possibility was a simple journal of zettel and pencil , because that &apos;s the standard method that you normally use when you start a diet and sports program .
another important idea is this notion of the reality crossing persistence of the character .
i style , i &apos;m laughing , i &apos;m really hard , because it &apos;s not about to be heard , it &apos;s going to be nice .
run away , don &apos;t get far . i fire : &quot; bang ! &quot; the narrator falls between two parked cars .
when he was writing on a broadway show , i was in front of the door .
i show a number of photographs and films , but i also do tv productions , books and a bit of advertising , everything with the same concept .
it &apos;s from photography that teaser , and it &apos;s pushing around poisoning and voyeurism , which you can &apos;t have , you want to be more surrounded .
as you creature into the collective consciousness , without knowing that , and how that happens .
it &apos;s very commercial .
and then you change the photo that it &apos;s going to shooting at , and suddenly it gets quite serious and maybe less approachable .
eighty-five percent of the global disease on cardiovascular disease is in the developing world -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the west .
just treating . look at the position in mauritius .
but if you tell them , well , we &apos;re trying to do the same thing in nigeria , everybody continues .
it allows for the existence of longer centers , and we can use the experience very much cleverly .
the concern needs to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s what we care about .
and we start a biomedical technology program so that we can learn local people that can repair the equipment .
autism has a very large bandwidth , very massive -- the child is not developing language -- to brilliant scientists and engineers .
liberally , i love the film , as you &apos;ve put all my projects on this -- this is the spinner inside of me .
well , what i learned early on was because i wasn &apos;t that focused on selling my work and not myself .
another thing is sensory problems .
in other words , to distinguish a problem with the equipment of a collaborator &apos;s problem .
it &apos;s called the film dr carlock .
i did practice during the colleges , and i also did things , and i learned how to do tasks .
another very obvious idea is to let the children of some of the many pennited computer specialist / inn teaching .
tg : i have a passion for making things i do , improving the world .
it &apos;s an expanded reality that can track projections and link systems , or it &apos;s just a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i &apos;m standing on this coast , the cuban cows , and i look out on the far horizon , and i think , again , i &apos;m going to do it all the way beyond the long , dangerous wild of an ocean .
but it went deeper , how much life is left there ?
and then we have our rule that you never really tell me how far it is , because we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but , quite frankly , all of these talks that i had trained to just get over to the training of the swim , they were quite different .
thank you and lots of fun at the conference .
and that may be the most tragic , it &apos;s lost its self-worth .
he joins the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so , what happens when a medium suddenly brings a lot of new ideas into circulation ?
they had to synchronize quickly , what other natural philosophers knew , otherwise you couldn &apos;t have the right kind of discussion .
but there was a programmer who decided that was not the best kind of work .
each of you can make changes , and you can put them together by any one of them , even if you didn &apos;t know anything about the existence of each other previously .
this is called a &quot; diff , &quot; this thing on the right .
one of the most significant things that can happen to a culture is that it can acquire a new culture of argument : sleeping procedures , votes , peer review , now that . right ?
don &apos;t try to improve what others do , a little bit better , because that &apos;s not going to get them very far .
and if somebody tells you that you can &apos;t do it , you don &apos;t listen to them .
six to nine months at the cheapest season .
but we &apos;ve tried these rovers before we sent them down there -- or this one rover -- and we made sure everything works .
so we sent a spacecraft along the way to mars , called the phoenix , and this probe will land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so you can put your clocks .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re at the same time that we &apos;re talking here to the next rover that we &apos;re trying to send to mars .
and i know many of you have talked about the last time that these airbags are really cool things .
there were two teammates who were especially interested in us .
it &apos;s kind of like the cycle of the earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water would be frozen .
today i want to talk about how these exponential technologies are to understand .
so we &apos;re looking at how exponentially growing technology affects health care systems .
this is an example of this paradigm shift .
there are already wireless things .
and i think many of these technologies will help us be better connected to our patients and to take more time to focus on the important human elements of medicine that are augmented with this kind of technology .
now , the current trend in medicine is , exponentially , to be smaller .
let &apos;s move to genomics 10 years ago , when the first human genome sequencing was done , the cost of about a billion dollars .
thanks to websites like patients like me or administration of their data on microsr healthvault or google , it &apos;s getting more and more important , to use all of these possibilities in a participative way .
we used the cells from the bone marrow to treat a patient with heart attack , we acquired an improved heart function and higher survival odds , the use of your bone marks retaliates cells after a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; dirt . &quot;
your cats , god knows how many who pinch on your previous bones , your fls , a resistant strain .
how they cross the shattered tiles , pregnant at stage in the street , buried , doesn &apos;t look at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was scared , an oppressed part of me would get out of control , and i would have trapped forever in the shocking lumes of her constant .
but i &apos;m afraid ricky comes in and shows his faux to me .
when we love it , it keeps me around me , i &apos;m there and i &apos;m not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that guide attention to critical issues , images that are crossing religions that transcend images that provoke us and do something , in other words , to act .
in 1980s , stigmatization with this disease was an enormous obstacle to discuss about this disease , or even mention it .
jonathan klein : photos that changed the world
i had read a lot of books and studied land and sea cards .
i was able to see me strapping the flag on the floor , you know , aah , a glorious moment , and the music was going to a crescendo .
finally , on the morning of the day , we got the start signal . we beludes the helicopter -- two helicopters in the tandem flight -- replacing me at the edge of the pack .
i knew there were more open waters of water , and i had a secret weapon .
i had known that , but i had expected something .
this was the view from my tent when i got this fateful call .
and just out of the air , i saw the big picture .
and they turned around and they wanted to go back to the coast , and all five died on the return journey .
and this was a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot .
but a few days later , we thought about this with our students , and we said , &quot; what would have happened if this guy was not in this state ?
one day in 1819 and a half thousand miles off the coast of chiles in one of the most remote regions of the pacific , 20 american seals saw falling their ship in the sea .
but at a certain point , most people learn how to give up visions like this and will grow .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to read their fears more closely than others .
and what &apos;s really read is an amazing gift of imagination , a kind of lightning vision , a way of looking at the future , if there &apos;s time to change their appearance .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them to every living room of the arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the masses , and now we see them collapse , one by one .
thank you very much .
because we discovered that it cares people , and people want to be informed -- they receive the stream through our internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m a 22nd line , and i look at the needle coming up to me , and there &apos;s blood everywhere .
you want to share a needle as little as you want to share a toothbrush , even with someone you glide with .
so this is a view of hundreds of studies of all the high animals of the science olympics in the united states , and these are the studies that show that nadel-audust programs are quite a lot of them .
so you can see these awful pictures from africa .
i &apos;m going to say , oh , super prevention strategy .
ines is a transgender-zero on the streets of jakartas . she &apos;s a girl with a tail .
she was 105 years old when i took this picture of her .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and a little banjo playing . here &apos;s a little medley .
we were out with the car at gatesville , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mother was just sitting on the car like this .
let &apos;s try it with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in the sky , i know .
originally , from the brothers , dopyera , who later built the dobro , an instrument with wooden body and metal congestion , where the sound emerges .
well , that &apos;s easier said than done .
we weren &apos;t stupid : we put a piece of wood in about five meters , and we put it in a piece of plywood .
when printing were new , the thought came to me was , why can &apos;t you take the oldest piece of music that combine &quot; hambone &quot; rhythms , and combine them with the latest technology ?
well , i think it works because scientists are connected as a community by ethics .
it &apos;s important to say something about the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute notion of space that was for newton god .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation that somehow created itself .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there is a constant framework and give and take the politics .
there &apos;s another tedster talking about here two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work in three different levels .
and just let it go there .
for five months , he was swing to try and experiment with a full kitchen crew .
it wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so forth .
or philip glass or lou reed or chemical brothers , they all played there , they all had their own casa da musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
a little bit of mug .
and it &apos;s a transition that has to do with the very much with the identity of the living , like with the memory of the dead .
but the emphasis and the ritual representation of wealth also shows the status of the deceased , and in the following , the family of the deceased .
if we could expand our definition of death to encompass life , we could experience death as part of our lives , and maybe encounter death with something other than fear .
i wanted to end my show with a dance ...
her talk about the water of living apes , and the relationship between darwinism and the fact that we &apos;re all naked , less comfort , and we can swim well .
ok , gordon , come on .
&quot; and now she has a kater . &quot;
eight years of american history , eight minutes of my show , they &apos;re just over that .
and jack nicholson says , &quot; i want to be a better person . &quot;
&quot; make this world a better place if you can .
so i &apos;m going to give you the message : don &apos;t try to go extinct .
where are the small ones ? &quot;
this is where people got wrong .
as you can imagine , it &apos;s one thing to cut up a leg bone , but when you go to a museum and you say , &quot; it doesn &apos;t bother you if i look up your clean skull , right ? &quot;
and you might think that &apos;s a clue .
so we &apos;ve taken off , and we &apos;ve collected a few animals , and we &apos;ve found a lot of small animals .
so we now know that torosaurus is actually an extended triceratops .
it looks like it could get even bigger .
we wanted to do atmospheric architecture .
all the water in the world is served here , so we thought that after you &apos;re on the water , you move through the water and you breathe water , you could also drink the building .
the drill was put on a robotic arm .
and then you get up on this glass lift at the front-face facade .
before and after .
this is a guy from salt lake city . this is what they look like .
&quot; are immersed &quot; -- as if they were seduced to go to violent crimes .
it &apos;s not sure that this would have been going on if the editor hadn &apos;t been a woman .
by the way , &quot; wired &quot; took this to heart .
analyze the news , talk about if something lacks , just like the people in the new york times did .
this particular plant filterates formaldehyde and other volatile chemicals out of the air .
m most of the time i get up in the morning when i get up , trying to figure out what &apos;s going to happen .
and then , remember , when condoleezza rice was wearing a event event , and was criticized for it ?
pm : did you meet resistance when you did this for the basic principle of your foreign policy ?
when i was secretary of state , only 13 women in other countries were secretary of state .
thank you for being with us today .
malaria : there are eight countries in sub-saharan africa that could reduce their death rates by 75 percent .
for data-friends like us , this is an erogenous zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that i &apos;ve been sexually aroused by this data collection .
to be precisely , today in their main city , some , want to save in those severe times , the treasury saves and save in life-saving programs such as the global fund .
on the contrary , it could save a lot of lives .
now if we take this metaphor of a genome as a program seriously , you have to think that chris anderson is a computer accomplished object , as well as jim watson , craig venter , and all of us .
you design something like a cell phone , and in very abstract language you &apos;re describing this cell phone .
this is normal dna , which you think is normal dna .
we heat them up , put a salt , heat them almost to the seventh point and cool them down , and in the refrigerating , the short strands gaping the long strands , and it &apos;s forming a structure .
so this works really well , and you can build patterns and shapes , ok ?
you zoom in , there are only four dna strands , and on them , there are parts of the strands that can stick to other tiles if they fit .
we have a very sensitive computer program where little changes -- tiny , single mutations -- take something that created a square of the size , and make something much bigger .
and the deployed calculations are molecular , and in order to understand that and get it better in access , as feynman said , we have to build something to understand it .
but just as we saw it , we had three core targets : to provide a world class of ambulance service that has fully self-sufficient sources and universally accessible to everybody with a medical emergency , regardless of their resources .
in modern times , where time is an important good , and the struggle is hard to survive , the ordinary serendipitous person gives up and pays the bribe just to move on .
in my last 18 months , as a lawyer , fighting small and large corruption cases , including india &apos;s greatest hideer .
sm : nunja , the falling cost was less than 200 rupees .
this is the global footprint of all tedx talks over the last four years that are emerging all over the world from new york to the little new zealand here in the corner .
in a lot of content like this , we tend to do a couple of things to make it easier .
so we use these networking motives to find unique talks , the ones that unite many different fields together in creative ways , that are essential to their topic , and those that behave really creative from different foundations .
no wonder it comes up to my colleagues , because the truth is hard to digest .
the work of the janitor could be as good in a body hall as it could be in a hospital .
ted is brillance ubiquitous .
how do these things happen ?
secondly , for you who are undoubtedly known nature of modern american school education , dreaming , step for education .
and they said , &quot; would you be willing to have a nuclear waste camp in your community ? &quot;
a way not to do that . teach more ethics courses .
why ? because you &apos;re happy to do something that &apos;s right .
bill gates talked about the importance of education and in particular about the model called kipp . &quot; knowledge is power . &quot;
barry schwartz makes a passionate call for &quot; practical wisdom &quot; as an antidote to a society that has lost in bureaucratism . he argues that rules often fail , incentives and practical , everyday wisdom will help us reconstruct our world .
&quot; by the way , dean , the arm has to fit a 50th percentile of a woman &apos;s form , so 81 centimeters from a small finger , and he has to weigh less than four pounds .
it takes another nine to make it functional and useful . &quot;
he &apos;s doing what darpa asked me about .
boys and girls , you &apos;ve already given enough .
it was amazing how positive they were all .
he wants to help . he told me that he wants to go back to help his buddies .
how do we get out ?
it can make war look like a tragedy or a farce .
ford moved . she sailed a leg , and then the other one .
in london , i lived in a glass box for 44 days with nothing but water .
and i shaped . in my first attempt to hold my breath , i haven &apos;t even pulled it out for a minute .
there &apos;s deep records where people dive as deep as possible .
it &apos;s six feet tall , and it weighs 72 kilos .
because of the movement , i wasted oxygen .
and then his main competition came and broke his record .
and there was no way to slow my heart rate down .
after 14 minutes , i had these terrible contractions like this need to breathe .
as a magician , i try to show people things that seem impossible .
cardiac congratulations . they have now graduated the facility .
tamara , are you kidding that ?
even now , the human mind is perhaps changing the world climate by the waste product of its civilization .
last year in africa , there are 600 million wildlife in africa , consuming two billion pounds of bush meat .
first of all , even if all the co2 emissions today stopped , climate warming would continue .
and then we saw a case coming to the east coast of the united states , and it moved more by each year .
today there &apos;s another movement . the movement to save the earth .
pharaoh ramses of the fifth one , the painting we see here , died of it .
i want to give you a kind of fast tour of introduction around what that change means : i want to explain to you what the implications of this change is for us and our biodiversity , but how much of this change is affecting our culture .
and if it was just about that , it would be really interesting .
and in this salmon , it &apos;s a genetically processed chinook salmon , which is made out of the intersection of a gene of this salmon and another fish , so it grows much faster with much less food . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ;
these are actually clubs and no real animals .
we took this animal to autonomy . &quot;
in other words , that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as a parent -- it had no organic parents .
paul root wolpe : it &apos;s time to criticize bio-design
if darwin only had nasa .
melanin , in its different forms , probably on earth for billions of years , has been recruited over and over again by evolution , as it happens so often .
and it &apos;s only in the last 5,000 years with increasing frequency and distance .
evolution helps us .
keep saying it .
so old and antic he also want to be , so he &apos;s very complicated and very simple -- and at the same time .
then they measure ... and measure ... and measure .
so , i kind of figured out a geometry of things that actually didn &apos;t have geometry at all .
it happened in the age of 1875 to 1925 , an extraordinary epoche in which mathematics was about to break out of this world . &quot;
long measurements , big brownian movements -- 1.33 .
and the bit irish is what &apos;s left behind it .
and this was one of my most significant discoveries , which is that these islands were the same as the large-format -- at least more or less .
should you remove the breast ? should you get them ?
right ? it &apos;s got to be waxy , and it &apos;s a particularly good thing to do .
anyone ? it &apos;s much harder .
this can happen in a medical environment .
and why not ?
a few months later , she goes back to the market , when prices are the highest , in what we call season -- when food is scarce -- because she has to feed her family and she has no choice .
that leads to very high cost of trade .
almost three years ago , i decided to leave my comfort job as a senior economist at the world bank in washington and go back to my country of birth to ethiopia after nearly 30 years of abroad .
we &apos;re building a system that uses all the market traces , the integrity , the trust , efficiency and transparency , and the small farmers are helping to deal with the risks that i &apos;ve described .
we believe that this initiative requires great political will , and we need to adapt to the financial sector , as well as the it sector , and even the underlying legal framework .
my answer to that is a sandstone wall made out of bacteria herself hardened sand , stretching through the desert .
it seriously threatens the basis of millions of people , especially in africa and china .
one problem with the plants of trees is that the people in this region are so poor that they deforestate trees to use them as a firewood .
and , after the unprecedented cost of 60 dollars for the bacteria that you would never have to pay again , a cubic meter bacterial sands would cost about 11 dollars .
in a time of unprecedented populations and growing food needs , that could be the kind of disastrous .
the world shows me opportunities , and i chose .
our goal is a fundraising meal of publishing , overconfidence , and completely , that a single debris dvd is basically a civilization-star package .
all these eggs , cysts , bacteria , viruses can all travel in one gram of human excrement .
it &apos;s a wonderful tool for falling away .
you might think it &apos;s just good karma if these men are shit , but it &apos;s also economic sense , because they save a billion dollars every year .
and they found that the family didn &apos;t have a toilet .
at the speed , we &apos;re not going to put people with sanitation facilities , we &apos;re not going to reach .
these reefs in discovery bay , jamaica , for 20 years , were the most studied coral reefs in the world .
he was feeding the slaves that were put on antillas . the song &quot; jamaica farewell &quot; -- &quot; aki rice salt fish &quot; -- is a sense of the importance of the fish fish in the northeast canada .
and we &apos;ve been able to do that in the last hundred to 150 years .
i &apos;ve talked about it for millions of times , but it &apos;s unbelievable .
the other kinds of climate change is the remaining of corals . it &apos;s a nice picture , right ?
that doesn &apos;t sell .
and yet we are , according to our best possible knowledge , alone .
what i saw ? stars , satellites , blind airplanes -- typical skirt .
and what would be behind these rubber masks if they were them ?
first of all , i was embarrassed because i didn &apos;t read the novel &quot; dune planet &quot; at the time .
and it was so successful that it was even filmed .
faro is a live little town , and to get to the beach , she said you had to take a bus and then take a boat .
one of them was called joseph , and he asked me about what i was doing , and i explained .
and this is how we stick in the trap .
the companies are providing goods for households -- we &apos;re -- and we &apos;re providing income , and that &apos;s better so that we can spend that income on more goods and good services .
the savings rate , net savings , was zero in the middle of 2008 , just before the crisis .
you can hear the minds of the five-year-olds .
and at the same time , the solution becomes clear , because it doesn &apos;t require changing human nature .
we need to , in fact , invest in the image of a meaningful sense of prosperity , which offer opportunities for people to evolve .
first of all , it means that economists should never get excited , so it might be that they have to celebrate something on their clay .
i painted it directly to the man .
it was about space and light .
this photograph was taken when i visited prudhoe bay in alaska 2002 to see the minerals management service in their driving process , burning oil spills in ice .
the other thing is that it &apos;s expanding when it hits water .
and this is really perverse .
and then , of course , there was john d. rockefeller .
she was also because of the national environmental policy , the clean air act , the clean water act .
they have conclusions in political science , in economics . they &apos;re entrepreneurs . they don &apos;t really want to do what they do .
if you look at people who earn 50,000 dollars a year who have two children who might have three jobs or more , and then you have to commute .
we have to rationalize the whole thing as rational , and you can find more about this policy .
the first person you &apos;re certainly familiar with .
this is what she tells in a film report to &quot; afghan star , &quot; about how her friends pressed them , not to be there , and they said they were leaving their friends for democracy .
last year i was here , i talked about my swim at the north pole .
it feels like somebody is standing behind you and beating you all the time with a hammer on your head all the time .
and there we sat down , and we talked about what went wrong there on mt . everest .
blogging about it , talking about it , talking about it , giving a hundred percent , because there &apos;s only very , very few things that can &apos;t be achieved if we put our whole force on it .
this is a graph of view . it &apos;s a very straightforward computer .
can we do some kind of self-replicating behavior ?
so what i &apos;m going to show you here is that we can make a 2d shape -- the b -- adds each other from a fraction of components that are extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes of ultraviolet .
and if you &apos;ve seen amy smith , she &apos;s talking about how to get students involved in working with communities in haiti .
and it may already be that all of the impressions of the world today seem overwhelming and connected with it , also the variety of problems that we need to solve .
we &apos;re increasingly aware that we don &apos;t even have to make the entire area of the city .
okay . i also have one .
can we reconnect to the natural ecosystems around us , and , for example , ripping rivers again and rendering them ?
as you can see , the death rate of 65,000 deaths per conflict , per year in the 1950s to 2,000 deaths per child per year in that decade , is so terrible .
because we did something right , and it certainly would be good at figuring out what it is .
they want the generic .
if you don &apos;t , one of the two needs to be updated , right ?
the developing world used soap and water , vaccinations .
and now i have the proper enemies coming on this axis .
and you remember the beginning of the last century , which was very bad , until this so-called big jump forward .
do you see how it grows ? and how hundreds of millions and billions of people get out of poverty in asia ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . that &apos;s the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they eradicate malaria .
and we have to look at the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t make it all over africa . don &apos;t make a race problem with it .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to happen around a superpower .
and many of you have heard the term memes . the evolution of technology is something that i give a lot of attention , you know , one of the first things you had was a little hanger .
my argument is basically that , well , non-zero-sum games have always been part of our lives .
and this is quite new , and i think it &apos;s getting even worse -- this possibility -- because of developments in information technology , in techologies that can be used as weapons , as biotechnology or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; yahweh is our trigger &quot; means &quot; he rescued the people of israle , &quot; which was a pretty sophisticated social structure at that time .
we only have civil wars in six countries , which is , the media reports only over six countries .
so , that &apos;s how should we put our money in it ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s most successful nation botswana , have ever eaten its rate .
in this process , we became the africans , at the edge of development , orientation and implementation of politics in our countries .
administration , mostly vetent economy , costs 690 billion .
we &apos;d like to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now 14 of the diseases are treatable , two of them are actually healing .
so in the last 10 years and as a hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology : a science of what makes life worthwhile .
and i think there are three different -- and i &apos;m going to call them different , because they &apos;re based on different interventions , it &apos;s possible to have one instead of the other -- three different lives .
but it turns out there was no sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t look like debie reynolds .
and what they find is that if they do a funny thing that &apos;s going to go away .
when i was a therapist 30 years ago , i thought if i was good enough to make somebody not depressed , i didn &apos;t get angry , i was going to make him happy .
a polar bear floating in the arctic taken by paul nicklen .
but this so-called &quot; snapshot &quot; happens when all the parts come together and not just the event , but also my emotional connection comes to it .
nick -- again , with a automatic camera -- has thousands of photos of this shot .
sometimes you can tell an extensive history in a concentrated way .
we want to find solutions as well .
and then somehow everybody runs off and jumps .
thank you .
what &apos;s even more important is that this is an fotometric process that you can capture in just three seconds : we can record emily in a period of less than a single afternoon in several different facial poses and expressions .
emily : image metrics is a branded , powerful animation company .
finally , i got involved in this .
there are some beautiful primates in the reserve .
but i was from the west , and i was working in the east .
all around the world , animals were constantly degraded , cutting the forest down , etc . , etc .
here &apos;s coltan degraded , and gold .
one day we met with the supercommander .
the elephant just wasted , and they took the brush .
i don &apos;t think anybody can blame google because google does the right thing , even when people like al-qaeda are using google to connect themselves .
corneille ewango -- a hero of the congo rainforest
we have moved , almost without even noticing , from a market economy to a market society .
you don &apos;t have to pay it by your budget .
i should tell you what happened to these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need perfect equality , but it needs citizens who share a common life .
passing the united states as the leading nation in 1900 , because it changes the line to red .
we got that gift back in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s when women have entered the working force .
electricity was also helpful for women &apos;s emancipation .
an amazing fact for technology optimists is that in the first half of the 20th century , life expectancy has increased three times the rate of the second half of the 19th century .
this was the assignment i took at the age of 11 , and i got a two-plus for .
i have some who kept a long time : between five and 15 , this should be my side preoccupation , and that led to a sense of failure .
so when i look at creativity , i think there &apos;s also this sense or the inability to suppress the connections that i see between virtually everything in life .
this is what buddhist fishermen say , because they can &apos;t actually kill creatures .
and you &apos;ll find it more often .
and i had to find what was in the story .
how are we going to determine what the responsibility and the causes are outside of a dish ?
and you have to be in all possibilities , including those i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you &apos;ll look at it when i use these examples , because i &apos;m actually talking about everything you might spend your time on .
now there are magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is they don &apos;t have anything in common .
the corners go down , goals to the center , that &apos;s the big market .
these guys are making the loudest automobile stereo in the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be ozzy osbourne -- you don &apos;t have to be completely overturned .
so what you have to do is figure out who &apos;s interested in .
nine months later , i was spraying messages at tahrir square , and the reason i saw a picture i was seeing in my newsfeed .
thank you .
most of the time the cultural heritage tends to look back and romanticize the past .
my first reports for national geographic , where i realized that you can bring environmental problems in a reporter about nature &apos;s history , i had dedicated seals .
these are the lions and tigers of the sea .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m kind of obsessed with them -- i wanted to make another , more positive story about sharks to talk about the need for protection of sharks .
after i left bimini , i learned that this habitat is being planted to create a new golden place .
they &apos;re also catching into fisheries .
but when the fish came back and they were ripping on urchin and controlling the population , the forests of seaweed water , growing in the flat water .
she now lives in the jungle of sungai wain , and this is matahari , her second son , by the way , the son of the second orangutans i saved , doy .
it was a biological desert .
and then you look at the yields , and you start measuring what &apos;s coming out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to tie the nitrogen , and without these microorganisms , there will be no performance .
the humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change the climate .
in northern suoahlisi , it &apos;s the genocide , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the justice to protect your own system .
the spiral whale whirlull surrounded a paddle on a canovum .
i &apos;ll just show you one more .
reuben margolin creates kinetic sculptures , beautiful works that move in the pattern of falling raindrops or united waves . in nine minutes , he fits us with his meditative art -- including inspired by mathematics and nature .
every city has its own design .
twenty-three years later , we were asked to come and develop this idea .
this is the italian portal , the ukrainian park , the polnian park , the japanese place , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
it either doesn &apos;t exist at all or it &apos;s something else , it &apos;s a computer program or something , but certainly not part of the science .
people always say that consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t doubt the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and to create consciousness , we just have to find the right program .
we are constantly bringing objectivity and subjectivity as qualities of reality and as properties of the instructions .
don &apos;t you think ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , love , and they can &apos;t imagine doing something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in the u.k.
teenagers don &apos;t wear wristwatches .
maybe later , not immediate .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
i couldn &apos;t make this thing work simply , no matter how often or how much i could get inside .
but we need to move from an industrial model to a agriculture model where every single school tomorrow can flourish .
erez and i wanted to figure out more about this .
and the reason for this is that the historical report is rapidly digitized .
and she came up with a light . she said , &quot; okay , so you &apos;re serious .
she performed a group of students at a test in the streets .
i stood up , made a tea , sat down and everything , and now i &apos;m here -- still almost paralyzed , but here .
so peace direct touches you the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the dictatorship to democracy &quot; with 81 proposal to violent resistance .
it &apos;s not such a cultical thing as well .
in fact , chris was worried , and she said , &quot; look , don &apos;t show you this photograph , you &apos;ll otherwise think you &apos;re another one of these mad modern artists who don &apos;t do much . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
and the solution , which i offer , continues to the largest practitioners in this massive abuse of earth through humanity and resulting destruction of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t of the counter -- let &apos;s call him t1 , where you amplify the effects , in the denominator -- call him t2 , where do you get the impact ? &quot;
and he was a strong distinction factor in the market that made our sales and the profits .
we &apos;ve literally won market parts .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , who was given one of my people from hitting california .
so , frankly , many of us who work in the industry are afraid that the industry is threatened by technology and might be deformed .
and in fact , do we need somebody to convey for us so that we have an experience with a divine ?
the arts , whatever they do , invite us every time they come together , to look at our courage and curiosity .
the three western scans , with her passionate music , occupied the piano of life . at tedwomen , they start with the joyful and poppy &quot; skylife &quot; by david balakrishnan . after all , they play a lovely , lizor version of pizzas .
the manchester manchester craftsmen is named after my quarter .
it makes a lot of money by making special furniture for rich people .
we sort of acquired the curriculum of the american costituts , which is in their sense the harvard of the cooking schools , and we created a gourmet cooking program for welfare mothers in this million-dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city .
we &apos;ve noticed that you have to give them flowers and sunshine and food and expectations and herbie &apos;s music , and so you can always cure the spiritual cancer .
these kids that were given up all over the world that fly from public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re able to do with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s worked very well to this day .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to have a concert , and i &apos;m going to give you the music , and you &apos;ll ever decide to sell it , you have to sign a agreement that says that the money is going to be used to support school . &quot;
this is a space that was built for nancy wilson who took their album in our school last christmas .
the brown building is that you &apos;ve looked at , and i &apos;ll tell you where i made my greatest mistake .
he came up to me after that . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he put together a group of people .
bill strickland shares a quiet and impressive story of art , music and unusual alliances .
and the transducer then creates the initial cells to guide the code to the brain , and the result is a retinal prosthesis that produces a normal retinal output .
but there was the limiting factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better respond to normal reactions , and so that was our contribution .
they cover us with a invisible body safety boundary that keep the attacks out of the environment so that we remain healthy .
but if the bacteria grow and double , and they all participate in making these molecules , then the number of molecules are going to be proportional to the cell number .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a picture -- a microscope of your skin .
bacteria have become incredibly medicinal resistant , which is to replicate that we kill with antibiotics bacteria .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior , and that they fulfill tasks that they could never ensure in their own , if they were to act as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor for me to come to this conference .
or the first one to come in the room .
but when we think about justice , aristotle says what we need to think about is the property nature of framed activity and qualities that are worth honoring them , admired and recognizing them .
what would you have for a reason ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here &apos;s how he puts it out .
so aristotle has flutes , golfunders , and the powerful question of same-sex marriage is the right of same-sex marriage .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic argument
a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , urban guys don &apos;t have us to tell us what to do with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humanity may make a choice like this .
if that is , what does that mean for us ?
i claim that the speed of treatment improvements is going to happen .
i &apos;m saying that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there &apos;s a threshold , because we don &apos;t have an aging condition before we get to a medieval age , and even though that &apos;s been assuming damage since we were born .
that means you have to do your homework to see if this is true .
audience : hello . i &apos;ve read somewhere that over the last 20 years , the average lifespan of practically longing every single planet by 10 years .
not one of their media has been able to do that .
we don &apos;t care how to make our win .
they marched into the center of reykjavik and put women &apos;s subjects on the daily order .
but i can &apos;t make design arguments that are more powerful than the arguments i &apos;ve learned from economists , epidemiologists and environmentalists .
the health argument is a little scary , and you probably know a part of the argument .
fourteen american people die a day of asthma , three times the same as in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from highway gasses .
he clearly had sense of humor .
politicians and marketing people are scared to march öko as &quot; lifestyle decision . &quot;
secondly , because we &apos;ve eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s do it . &quot;
there are some amazing animals .
immediately the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;re going to get rid of it . &quot; and afforded people to slaugh everyone they saw .
he might think he would have ever born the most ugly baby , so he might need some help from the outside .
i asked peter if something changed , and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
now we want to talk to &quot; africa : the next chapter , &quot; and that &apos;s a healthy , smiling , beautiful africans .
but most of all , they have to be productive in their lives , and they have to create a kind of productive environment in our countries so that things can be done .
we can connect all of this ?
we were on the side of the biafra .
i had to crawl in between the legs of these people through crawls , with my sister on my back , to find a window .
you know , we have to use everything well .
and often i don &apos;t see any african staff of them .
the question now is , how can we benefit from all this good will that we get out of ?
you are undisciplinary . &quot;
we have ibukun awosika in nigeria with the chair factory .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effectively a neurological product , i took this thesis so that we can study it , just like we can study a different complex neurological process .
the method has been applied since the &apos; 90s to study extremely complex things .
i want to try and show this for you .
and then i &apos;m in the control room , here , games in change .
now , how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s involved in movement coordination .
i want to say that probability and statistics , that &apos;s the math of games and happiness .
it &apos;s very time-consuming , and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but it &apos;s the idea of the entire time of eight seconds .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , their facial expressions can be , of course , used and intuitively to control an avatar or virtual character .
otherwise , they declared very fast , and without a stable power grid , that &apos;s not possible , so children die .
another statement of esther was that we react when it comes to a tragedy like haiti , but this is an ongoing tragedy .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria parasite , and it &apos;s a very interesting crystalline substance .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in your bluray-player , it &apos;s a very cheap blue laser .
audience : aye .
and what &apos;s interesting is , even though we &apos;ve murdered them all the time , we &apos;ve never been able to defend the wings in the air .
this is the restaurant acorn house .
this orange tree that you see here is actually growing in a car car gaps that &apos;s turned from the outside and being flattered .
so , water is an important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; still stand .
the idea is not mapped yet .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
as soon as it touches the water , you should hear the air escape .
and as soon as we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is to represent the smallest genome of a self-replicating species , could there be even a smaller genome of it ?
moreover , we realized that once that worked , we would have a real chance , if we could get the synthetic chromosomes to do it in the same way .
care is incomplete .
and finally , the last one is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t construct myself , i can &apos;t understand that either . &quot;
but we &apos;re actually living here in the northwest very close to the actual idea of the koran of paradise , defined 36 times as &quot; gardens , irrigated by flowing flows . &quot;
but the more you add , the more it seems to be lost .
and that number , 72 never happens .
this is a pile of a ripe colony , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony that was founded by a queen in the summer before .
the patrollers -- this is supposed to be a magnifying glass -- they &apos;re an interesting group . they go out in the morning before the first group goes out for foraging .
and oddly enough , and interestingly enough , it looks like about half of the ant colony just doesn &apos;t .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpick and get them to the outer edge of the nesthük , and they deposit there .
but somehow the foragers decide not to get out .
and we did experiments that show that the longer an ant is hanging out , the more the simple hydrocarbons on its surface , so the ants smell different from doing different work .
they cover all the soil apart from antarctica .
here you can see that the cost of all this for the world in about 89 million barrels of oil , and the cost of three trillion dollars a year .
and that &apos;s what we do for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with it .
i &apos;ve been thinking about where we can use the natural gas .
and as i got into the wind business , natural gas was nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry about that ?
that was simply defeated 500 million .
this has never been contaminated or something like that .
tbp : i lost 150 million in the wind , okay ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there was dotcom fever , and there were gold fiber .
ourbeginning.com. life is an event . announce it in the world .
these are work in lower manhattan , where you built with the first power plants .
these were in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to occur the light socket .
a friend of mine told me this story : they didn &apos;t just come and have to wait , but then the professionals , when they ended up there , for the third time , they had to call someone .
and so sometimes i &apos;m going to use a more clinical language , and so maybe it won &apos;t be as warm as the heart of people talking about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that mimic creates good actions for people who are going to revanish for it .
basically , when you &apos;re my enemy or my rivals , if you &apos;re not my friend or belong to my family , i tend to use the golden rule on you . okay .
so or so , the results are going up . this is a zero-sum game .
every form of interdependence , non-zero-sum relationship , forces one to recognize the humanity of the other .
and they then explain to you , the other people think that america doesn &apos;t want to respect them and actually dominate them , and they hate america .
most of the diseases correlate to poverty , but in the case of cancer in children , the children who died of cancer seemed to have cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a child died every week , but nothing changed .
because you just don &apos;t get the kind of energy and the time if you don &apos;t really care about it .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the dominant cancer theory would say that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cancer cell , and that it makes you a cancer victim .
what does that mean ?
we found a sort of fatty material that contains the right extracellular matrix , we put the cells in and lo and behold , about four days they were umorized and on the right , and you see what we created in a culture .
and of course we &apos;re asking ourselves now , where are we going now ?
and so i want to close with a poem .
we have a highly skilled journalist who was caught at writing ; a young star-writer whose book contains so many fined quotes that you took it out of the shelves ; an exposé about colored book reviews in the new york times .
it sounds a bit like a strange book , but it &apos;s actually new kinds of lies .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you had four good friends of a person who assessed their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lies ; they used to be spoken and then they went on .
they were telling how big the bath was , or they said the shopping capabilities are like this and so far away from the hotel .
woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , take a picture !
and also , you want to freeze your eyes .
but it really opened my eyes , how often i &apos;ve excluded from life for emails , social networks and so on , even though there was nothing really important or urgent .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of juillard .
and everyone who rotated then i was walking backwards .
at least for me , because every time i do the same thing , i get very , very boring . i &apos;ve been very fast .
i think of myself as -- i don &apos;t know what i see .
are you getting nervous , ashleigh ?
im : do you worry ? you look so cute .
as usual , i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s good , it &apos;s just that it &apos;s not boring , ok ?
if you &apos;ve buttered the juice too long , it &apos;s buttermilk .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- what do people listen to different races or ethnicities , but as citizens can all be the same .
in egypt , i had finally been discovered .
this one had studied in london , trained in yemen and got an airplane in amsterdam to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating for democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , bin laden &apos;s family is one of the richest family of saudi arabia .
what happened there was a political coalition that came together for a political goal , and that was to get rid of the leaders .
these tools only become socially interesting when they get bored .
it conveys the boundaries of individual networks and then turns them in .
and because of the social interconnectivity , chinese students who were studying abroad , or companies from the rest of the world had the offices in china , there were people all over the world who heard these news .
and finally , the chinese attacked .
we &apos;re more and more in a media landscape in media globally , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
but all looking at it , i &apos;m still going to vote the way i had it forward .
in my fourth drop-up to everest , a comet pulled over the mountain . hyacoutake .
this is the icefall up . the first 600 meters of the rise of base camp .
and this is in camp 4 .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck weathers , another climber , collapsed in this storm in the snow .
it &apos;s so thorny working up there , that sometimes i actually gave syringes straight through the clothes .
this climber was snowblind .
and i can only measure how he did that .
and so he &apos;s going to turn thoughts back into action .
these are sherpas , the wax branches on fire .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s most important to me is , &quot; ideas that we have to participate in . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the entrepreneurial rise , entrepreneurs became role models , and they contribute in large-scale to society .
it was close people who wanted to introduce democracy , because they came up with ideas , from the universal election right , parliament and constitution and so on .
the third thing is , again , cities .
the second is the employment policy that we have that entrepreneurs are so difficult to create standardized jobs in companies that 93 percent of the indian jobs industries are unorganized .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , again , you have a chance to have a modern retirement system , so you don &apos;t have the problems that you have when you get older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important for india and important to the world .
so the government decides to let the vote again .
even though some people on the left don &apos;t like to hear at all , it was actually the market revolution that gave the loop , &quot; the government has no idea . &quot;
they don &apos;t fear the masses anymore .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the folk representatives and the ones that they represent .
thirty-four .
each of these cohorts would be statistically suited for two years after the prison prison .
david cameron invested 20 million pounds into a &quot; social outcomes fund &quot; to support this idea .
toby eccles : investment in social change
i &apos;m working . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the cheeks ?
even when i &apos;m there with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; i welcome you , jack . servus , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t figured it out , my name is tom thum , and i &apos;m a beatboxer , which means i &apos;ve done everything you &apos;ve just heard , just with my voice alone .
and lastly , with this one on my right , i can keep my sounds -- again , again , again .
our people had to try and do about 5,000 different mixtures to figure out the right thing .
don &apos;t listen to those who say you can &apos;t do that . anybody can do it .
on the right is to see an ultrasound transducer .
and i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you see the blue wall lighting .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in her life . &quot;
many of these patients refer to radiation therapy .
the results are better than the surgical ones .
he can stop the procedure at any time and immediately .
canal street , i know .
and that &apos;s where you really get a lot of your creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry running in both directions .
and that &apos;s why you want to go to the next trend and do it as quickly as you can .
and their jokes , like the fashion design design design design , really only work within this aesthetic .
you need a lot of lawyers to do this , a lot of time , and the dealers have decided that it would be way too expensive .
these are the two main rather binary sentences within the logic of the copyright .
and i really want to thank you , at this point , veronica jauriqui , for making this very fashion presentation .
one time , a boat took me to a remote fjord , and i realized that archaeologists that i was supposed to meet were not up .
i think this is one of the most staggering and robust things on the planet .
there are many ancient jews on peacekeepers all over the u.k. , and once you calculate , you realize that the bugs were there in front of the churches .
here &apos;s the clonical creosotebush , which is about 12,000 years old .
i hope that by finding these organisms , i can help to focus on their remarkable robusy , and can help me contribute to my part of the longevity of longevity in the near future .
let &apos;s put it on something else .
20 years later , criminals still use mobile phones , but they also make their own mobile phone networks , like this , which is used by the drug cartel mexis in all 31 states .
what did they do with it ?
what could terrorists do today , using the technology available now ?
recently , the fbi arrested an al qaeda member in the united states who wanted to use these remotely controlled drones to transport c4 fuel fuel in government buildings in the u.s.
as we see here , we turn ourselves into cyborgs .
already , 70 percent mortality rate is 70 percent if you get it , but that &apos;s hard .
there are so many people being killed that the only fine funeral in non-labeled grasses like this one outside of ciudad juarez can be made .
but on the other hand , i hear people talking about fear , a certain aversion of risk .
and tragically , in 1999 , she was working in colombia with the u &apos;wa-people , with the goal of preserving her culture and language , with two other colleagues of the farerillas &apos;s farc &apos;s guerillas and tortured .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more prone to this kind of manipulation than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people who are searching simple solutions , easy categories , because we don &apos;t consider the pure instrument .
but the whole community , all the different seats , the shia and sunni , would sit together and pray . &quot;
because if it &apos;s full of juice , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , it &apos;s feeding the world , it &apos;s enough to go to the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make my wife a little joy .
why don &apos;t i make committed to my wife &apos;s own , regional produced bonds ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company makes binds out of cotton and it works .
muruganantham : i see this thing in my wife &apos;s hands , &quot; why are you using a climb load ? &quot;
now , 110 countries can access it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that in the last seven years i &apos;ve been there .
and then i did a huge amount of training . i swam down and forth in icewater .
it actually happened that the cells froze in my fingers and began to expand .
and my good friend david saw how i thought , and he came up to me and said , &quot; lewis , i &apos;ve known you , i &apos;ve been 18 years old .
the prospect that you could extinct in 30 , 40 years is a very frightening .
england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion gallons of oil on earth today that can be locked and nurtured .
now , the end of the story could be -- okay , we &apos;re just replacing all this with conventional , renewable resources -- but i think it &apos;s more about the story .
it &apos;s especially material that the abalone make itself , millions of sea ears , all the time , every day , every year .
and the idea was basically that i was the paintbrush in the hand of great personalities coming and i would interview them .
but i wanted to interview , which is different .
in fact , my first interviewer george abbott , who was 97 years old , and abbott was full of life power -- i think you can define it that way .
we know the great sprays , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to share , and the sense of the thing is to not make anybody ridiculous .
when we were alone , i was listened to her .
it was not this arm , but it was a moment of surprise for my conversation partner .
he said , &quot; but i understand . i can understand that . &quot;
half the body was chosen , the other one was not .
this is a cleaner intensive care station in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do beautiful things .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called exchange transfusion .
it &apos;s not the painting that we would have painted , it &apos;s what we actually painted .
another example : again , a stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we &apos;re talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank accounts in songs in songs , from the prime of the president &apos;s prime , the high officials of the state areas .
they were even paying attention to that .
now , most of the big companies , though , are unconvinced that they have to use very strict guidelines against bribery and so on .
if you want to go to a restaurant , if you look at the menu , you will expect you to do everything on the map ?
and that was the first time that i thought that the expression on her face actually reflects what she thinks of him .
well , he &apos;s dividing his life .
this french painter of the 18th century was known for his still life , but he also painted people occasionally .
unfortunately , these orphans are now spending their most of the time with a series of other orphans in the archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
for the first time , i carried it on a wishing dinner that gave their parents to honor us .
&quot; i gratulate you to your impressive wedding , james .
my father also lived most of his adult life in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
lancelot imasen : but our movies , they &apos;re stories that our people can identify with .
in order to really get a young man out there to get what can do , he has to think about certain negative things and do all of this , or do any imconvenient behavior .
franco sacchi : so many things to say , so little time .
i think this is really the topic of this event .
franco , you described this as the third largest film industry in the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . it &apos;s a trading disk .
now the art critic . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even though they &apos;re utterly humanities .
we &apos;re showing &quot; portal , &quot; because you &apos;re shooting on walls to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most importantly , behaviors .
on my way , i had to break some bridges behind me .
everything refers to the construction gentlemen and students who were told by the first meeting that they were going to be refused to a place .
so i did some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and morandi-like things that i normally drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army knife , which i expect to be involved in .
and one day i had a -- oh , the other way around .
i &apos;ve performed the heart , and the copper is very thin , so it &apos;s cloudy .
and this is my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i interact with things like my house as defensive .
she was never finished .
the dome was a baumaster &apos;s wish .
it was an attempt to turn this narrow piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 to 76 meters -- into a creature by putting these areas apart and the living room in this pavilion , with a high space in it .
they call this &quot; plan coupé . &quot;
here it is .
from the building in the background , it appears as the passing iceberg in the mountains .
so our publisher doesn &apos;t want galleries , so -- and when we met our new acoustician , he told us that this was the right shape or that .
in barcelona , i was asked to do a fish , we &apos;re working on the foot of the ritz-carlton tower , which was built by skdmore , owings and merrill .
can &apos;t we make clean burning cooking fuels ?
and one of the things they found out was they didn &apos;t burn .
and these are our homemade briquettes .
and he compared the problem of health impacts of burning wood and coal .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , if this was india , in this room , only three of us would have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts as you do in the united states to do things .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after surgery , everything is normal .
well , that &apos;s not surprising . but we also asked them to rate their honesty and intelligence , kindness and aggressive .
he married . he had a son called jerehmia .
is this business with our outer factories and our occupation with this western phenomenon ?
now i want to tell you a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we are and where we want to go .
we can replace the lowering bone structure , but we &apos;re not very far in replacing facial replacement .
my topic is food in schools , because this is social justice .
and the next one is bio-food .
people talk about sustainability all the time , but we should figure out what that is .
do you know that everybody thinks they have to eat more and more ?
and they got it out , hey , we can sell the stuff to kids .
and this is a typical food plan .
the things that we might do at home and think are so important that we have to teach kids in the schools .
we have to educate the employees .
this eight billion , by the way , means two dollars and 49 cents -- that &apos;s how much money will provide the government for lunch .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather was sitting on a hot summer days outside in the sun .
when i go to a party and people ask me what i &apos;m doing , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; your eyes become matt .
i want to undermine their self-confidence , undermining everything about their inner nature -- that they are themselves a professional man in their own conscious minds .
don &apos;t break the tension . i &apos;d rather be confused .
it &apos;s a documentary film in a game length about consciousness .
when i got closer , i expected to see all the details of most people , their clothes and so forth .
how do you know it was , what did you do ?
see it ? who of you don &apos;t see it ? that will help .
we take a look at it . some examples .
this morning , jeff hawkins described his efforts to bring a good , big theory into neuroscience .
and the traffic laner in london said , &quot; what do you mean to me is , &quot; who &apos;s perpetually for londons -- &quot; i mean , no one &apos;s in charge . &quot;
now , congestion pricing were introduced in stockholm on january 3 , 2006 , and the first picture ; here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical road on january 2nd .
so , we did this enormous survey with lots of traffic issues , trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
and then i went east forward -- from east europe to central asia -- through the mountains of the caucasus , mid-east , north africa , russia .
what do we know about the taliban &apos;s death threats to the doors of the people , the chariot their daughters send their daughters to schools like in balkans ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was tidied up , and i had the blue separation tap on the walls .
and there were two of them even .
there was really something .
how amazing is that ?
i want to just briefly talk about some other patients doing everything in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized that the page of google earth reminded me where we could fly to any address .
we are , they are the most underutilized resource in health care .
umkehrosmosis of seawater is a membrantering technology .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment with the help of sound waves . i &apos;m talking about the airports .
in the united states alone , the annual cost of being utilized 22 billion dollars is what bats take us , in any case , prosperity .
why should we care about aging at all ?
if you go out here and look into the night sky and see this beautiful , flying animal , i wish you smile . thank you .
europe had to be distorted into economic development .
now , the commodity booms don &apos;t pumple any of the resources , but a lot of countries in the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s going on ? why is there something called resource curses ?
and so the countries of the bottom billion need a very extinct policy .
a few economists just came in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try to cover an auction ? it &apos;s going to unveil the value . &quot;
in this moment , there &apos;s a billion people sitting in the world , poor or failing countries . how can we help them ? the economist paul collier shares a coin , compassionate plan that we can end the gap between poor and poor .
we have no containers in which they &apos;re making .
and here he gives an english language surgeon in africa this basic knowledge that &apos;s needed to mimic minimal-invasive intervention to do it . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so what we have here is : imagine if you had a lecture , and you could talk to people at the same time in their mother &apos;s language .
&quot; basics of laparoscopic surgery .
14 years ago , i first came across this common material , fishing net that &apos;s been used in the same way for centuries .
he asked me if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
so we experimented with little atomized water particles to create a dry fog that &apos;s shaped by wind , and in the test it turned out that it can be shaped by people who can interact with it and can move through without a pinch .
they were in their business trains in the grass , watching the pattern of the winds alongside people they didn &apos;t know , and they shared the rediscovery of wonder .
and so i also realized that this is an enormous risk for our society .
when peter moves his arm , this yellow spot that you see there is the appealing place to the activity divorced in peters .
if you do that , what are you going to control ?
and to say that changes like that can occur beyond death is itself a claim about a fact that can , of course , be true or wrong .
now let me tell you what i &apos;m not saying , i &apos;m not saying that science can make this space guaranteed , or that we will have scientific answers to any conceivable moral question .
now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
what &apos;s the probability that this is a summit of human development ?
on the left side , you see edward witten .
we live in a world full of destructive technologies , and these technologies can &apos;t be invented un-invented , and it &apos;s always easier to break together as they tickle together .
but then again , we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what is its natural enemy , what is the means of the bio-control of the good beetle that we &apos;re talking about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , it &apos;s not a biased but a parasitic wasp , two mm , snake , a quick and agile fly .
and if we take these good flower bugs , for example , in a flower field , they go to the bloom .
in israel , for example , where we &apos;re going to go over 1,000 hectares -- that &apos;s equivalent to 10,000 israeli dunams -- biological harmful reduction in sweet pesticides , 75 percent of the pesticides were saved .
third , to increase the awareness of farmers &apos;s minds for the potential of this business .
automobilretrofuturism is one of my specialties .
it &apos;s even fun to make fun of the mindless rich people than i do about anybody else . i often do it .
&quot; urban absurdism &quot; -- that &apos;s what the new yorker needs .
her first name was fay wray , and that was -- i wasn &apos;t striking enough to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the collapse of the soviet union was only a few decades , maybe within a decade after the time that the soviet union was most powerful .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eat insects .
they are at the beginning of nutrition .
why do we actually do these balls in the soup at all , well , it &apos;s meat in it anyway ?
it &apos;s 25 kilos per person per year .
so far , we &apos;re going to decide for one thing , or up to five kilograms of yield .
we can increase them a little bit at the expense of rainforests , but there &apos;s going to be a reduction soon .
and you might think , well , they &apos;re not available yet .
my three minutes haven &apos;t begun yet , right ?
and he said , &quot; allison , we have to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if canadians are leaving the system , they &apos;re doing it in a way that society is coming .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a linear tool . and on the back , there are some other gadgets , measures , scales , to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , this is how the device is used .
there &apos;s a quality of craftsmanship and precision that &apos;s just astonishing and remarkable .
so , the first robot i want to talk about is strider .
it &apos;s just being used to show that if you have cameras , or other sensors , because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s 80 meters in size , you can see about bugs and things that go away .
for example , in this case , although the left and the right wheel are connected to a single axis , and therefore turn quickly .
welcome to romela , the robot mechanics lab of virgina tech . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the user interface .
let &apos;s see how it does . this was our first attempt , and ... toooor !
but what is the secret of our success ?
but just talking about a spark of imagination is not enough .
in this way , education is very important .
interior cities that become host cities .
there &apos;s basically no pool of well-qualified teachers , and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor or or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a complete empty thing about creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the teammates sitting on tires , then that team won .
but for the last few decades , a lot of money that was meant for workclass was entirely gone .
and going outside and interviewing the neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why , there &apos;s a homework .
in this one , it &apos;s skilled to create large barrels of space .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of thinking and discovery .
after four months of rainy time , it smells up , and now it &apos;s eight months of dry season .
here &apos;s some outcomes .
this global is going to act on the same level of climate change as fossil fuels do , maybe even more than that .
and when i learned about these two things , it took me very , very , both for personal reasons and for scientific reasons .
it &apos;s got a very well-equipped pediatric eye center , which was funded by ronald mcdonald foundation , part of the ronald mcdonald foundation .
after treatment , we let the child make a whole bunch of simple vision tests every time , to see how their vision is adapted .
and the answer is moving . i want to show you in the next video .
i had to discuss with my wife for a long time .
we &apos;re going to watch this research , and hopefully we &apos;ll have more results .
and then , i &apos;ve heard about these chtathletic sessions for physically disabled runners , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know that , but before i tell you about it , i &apos;m looking at what this is like .
but that was in the fall of &apos; 95 , and then when the winter ran , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then aimee did the paralympics in 1996 , and she &apos;s excited . her family travels with -- it &apos;s a big deal .
i was trying to ask anybody i could think of who , against which runner , so who am i standing on top of ?
i &apos;d always won everything , and now i thought , what ?
you can be 2.4 meters tall . just take it off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and designer will be at ted med 2 , and we will talk about the design .
they got somebody who came by and saw the shoes .
it &apos;s almost impossible to extend the actual losses of the economy , unless we use copyright math .
or about 75,000 jobs .
and something else about math : math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- like , &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math education , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do step three by hand .
when people ask me , is that true ?
but the automation in cars allowed it to separate these things , so today driving is something different than building a car and learning how to do it .
totally reverse .
but i think we can do both of these things at the same time .
and one of the reasons why this is so important -- so , it &apos;s very important to engage computers in the exams .
it was winter in 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year or so .
i was particularly thinking about my father , who passed away by a complication of a surgical intervention on the brain .
similarly , just by the grip of the stock that can change nature of the land , and over time , there &apos;s an idea of where you are and what you &apos;re headed for .
but when i was blind , and i was walking along broadway , i was blessed at every corner .
if you design a city with the blind in mind , there will be many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience that article was called &quot; i think you &quot; re fat . &quot;
and the broadcast of the famous i knew -- the ten commandments , love your next one , be fertile , and most of you ...
you donate money for a good purpose , and you give them emotional participation in purposes .
it &apos;s not a book written , and it came from heaven .
so , to me , this is actually the key to luck to remind me that , on the way here , the car is not overwhelmed , and i don &apos;t stumble on the way through the stages .
that was very inspirational for me .
so if we &apos;re going to regain some sense of this book , then we really have to engage it , and we really have to penetrate it with it .
so we have this wonderful progress .
and the academicians who were doing this work , thought this was too rubbish , so we developed more serious applications like this sort of optik-prototype that the toothbrush of toothbrush on a cardboard becomes a laser .
alex worked on a little , some obscure , independent art film called &quot; minority report &quot; for steven spielberg , and invited us to develop the interface that &apos;s supposed to be used in the movie .
we do this booleses surgery because we like yellow and tapire on green grass .
let &apos;s pull that apart : i &apos;m going to put it in an explosion view .
we , as humans , are the things that make , and we should make sure that our machines help us build on it and build on it .
john , thank you for doing science fiction to reality .
what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology .
but here &apos;s the point . the most albernest creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are presented by this black line said , &quot; we &apos;re going to change this defecation immediately .
they are created by the members of the community for each other .
and like all the good soap operas , it makes a leap of 20 years when the audience &apos;s interest changes .
you don &apos;t have always spent five days , so changes came , and we started playing 50-overcricket .
india didn &apos;t want to play with the world 20-world championship .
the other one was indian cricket .
was this new india ? that was another world where you could get players from everywhere , as long as you got the best players to the best prize .
we &apos;ve all seen games in calcutta , but we &apos;ve never seen anything like this . shahrukh khan took the audience with a gallery song to the jewish -- for calcutta , not for india , but for kutta .
could you imagine that day was coming ?
hopefully , every one of you have done a richer experience , and the game more popular , and hopefully you have the cricket-commentators a long time to work in this business .
and you know that the answer is dogs , because they &apos;ve evaluated quickly in memory , how often they &apos;ve seen dogs and pigs on the leash .
why on earth should anyone play lotto ?
on the other hand , if you go to a developing country , and you can buy a gourmet menu for 25 dollars , it &apos;s a growing price for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the path to the other end of the city is worth 100 mice , it &apos;s worth 100 mice , completely no matter what you &apos;re going to do , but people don &apos;t think that way .
well , by and large , you &apos;re enormously impatient .
so watch what happens when we go out there .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more . so you say that our answer to terrorism is , i mean , he &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there are no weapons fire .
and this is how some people look at economists as dumb people .
topic and variation is one of these toys that require certain intellectual activity , because you always compare the variation with the topic that you have in mind .
it &apos;s -- &quot; in words and in fashion , the same rule and equally fantastic when new or too old or too old -- not the first thing that you try out the new one or the last one of the old one ever since . &quot;
and i woke up one day and i said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not like this ? &quot;
first of all , my willingness to expose me to a critical audience without suggesting that i am too secure myself .
it &apos;s my intention to accommodate the poster literary , and you shouldn &apos;t understand it yet .
so in large and large , they save our survival .
jews often have an awkward smell .
if the room stank , we were able to see people exposed more negative attitudes to gay men .
it &apos;s like i &apos;ve come home to talk about what i &apos;ve done in the distance for those 20 years .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other filmmakers , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i got sick .
we don &apos;t need any more trouble with the idiots !
our government was corrupt .
so to me , the idea is that we have all these children , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children who had to do so much psychological trauma or damage , and africa needs to live with it .
through the whole book , more than an hour of documentary contributions and interactive animations .
what &apos;s the business for this ?
it had , at least , the assumption that you , wherever you have , remain faithfully true .
so i thought , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
they &apos;re still talking about it .
when i got to college , i worked in southern california contextually , and you used to go to the spanish colonial brick on the roofs and stuff like that .
rsw : what does his timetable look like ?
the mit project -- they &apos;ve been interviewing me for the mit , and they &apos;ve sent their technical aid to bilbao .
that reminded me of it .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; this , what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
when you walk around with three wishes for four months , ideas become more and more clear and more alive .
and one of the things i wanted to mention in my thanksgiving , but somehow missed was to thank all the companies that helped me get in .
but in the meantime , these things get momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , demolized by hand .
you see the suits , the flowers .
the cacophony of stiles and things are remarkable , and this is what the villas are supposed to be .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five uppes and the sixth is built here .
at this level , there are 1,500 workers working .
50 percent of the computers in the world land to recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture as a main issue .
and wish three is , imax film . i was told to do it myself , and i always wanted to work with this .
and it becomes increasingly important that we &apos;re trying to figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complex waste currents .
the traditional ways of separating materials don &apos;t work for plastics .
the traditional way of making plastics is happening with oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed plastics composition : many different kinds of plastics and many different qualities of plastics .
now i see a lot of griners out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes in the same way , again and again .
maybe we should study how the monkeys make economic decisions and see if they &apos;re going to do the same stupid things that we do .
here &apos;s mayday . she &apos;s going to trade a token against food and waiting for happy , and she gets food .
she waits a little impatient for the market to open .
now imagine that every one of you will put 1,000 dollars in your hand -- 10 kicks hundreds of dollars .
you can either choose a risky loss -- like this , i &apos;m going to throw a coin . in head , you &apos;re really going to lose a lot .
if we made the same scenarios in our little monkey market , would they do the same things that people do ?
the person on the left is a safe loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just people in the last stage of development that make stupid mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but when we think of wood buildings , they &apos;re usually just four stories tall .
we have to build less concrete and steel , and we have to grow higher , and we &apos;ve been working on 30-plus wood buildings recently .
that &apos;s as much as if in a year , 900 cars are less on the streets .
coaching curtains covered my windows .
maybe even &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently they &apos;ve been standing up to fight the dispense of justice , and the citizens of these networks are working together to help each other .
sberbank , the largest and oldest bank in russia , largely in ownership of russian government , is now taking crowdsourcing to implement employees and citizens into developing innovations .
we &apos;ve heard talks at ted about people hacking their crops with arduino , and mozilla works to motivate young people to create web sites and make videos all over the world .
and so i started to think that the eternal mother always asks himself , &quot; are all children there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to translate a message , and all of them in their own language refer to a central consideration that was a version of the golden rule , &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do to do to you , that fed no other . &quot;
to be a pastor is to take care of these individual needs .
and we &apos;re doing this through some examples .
there are over 180 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s already taken by parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made up of silicon fiber optics .
there are also some constraints in the lighting process .
the bubble is an anti-memorial .
i saw my aunt raped when i was only five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend , because we didn &apos;t have food and we were about 400 .
as a kid so young and so delicate , words i can &apos;t forget , are not forgotten .
this is my story , communicated in the form of a lesson reminder .
my breakfast , my lunch , i end up with a foundation that i founded , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the tools to the farmers .
audience : aye .
the third chapter is an even more complicated legal procedure called federal hebeas corpus proceeding .
that means more than 60 percent are for that .
so the best way to do this is to scale the problem of death penalty .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late yet .
i don &apos;t remember time when i was five years old .
christmas man knows if you were good or not . right ? &quot;
but , julie , you were so ready for school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiled , in the sense , that was the right answer . then they kept asking , &quot; do you think we &apos;re all brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your larger capacity to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the toughest view of modern times , &quot; the road . &quot;
in world war ii , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we must not forget that it needs a fundamental contribution to this , and that &apos;s how many of the resources of the planet we use .
but now the good news !
it may be in latin america .
and at this point , the skeptics and denominators of climate change emerge .
we did a project for the ministry of science a couple of years ago , which was a big program , which meant the subsorted program -- with many , many people -- many experts were involved -- all in evidence -- a thicker forests .
a group of people hire them to spend it on themselves , and the other group is supposed to spend it on other people .
when they went from the first building to the second , all of them walked by a man who got curved and dreamed , and clearly needed help . the question is : did they believe in and helped ?
the word is &quot; pizzled , &quot; a combination of puzzled &quot; and &quot; pissed off . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; something : stuff : the hidden life of everyday things .
since now -- it &apos;s four decades &apos; worth of passed -- i trained with the best in this field , had done shows around the world , taught young and old , collaborated , choreographed , and mapped a rich grid of art , success and sketaked drawings . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life force .
i danced between chemo and radiant cycles and i urged him to fit them on my procedure .
well , it was essentially frustration .
that &apos;s what it was then .
he put it together , combined it into something more interesting , and then he transformed it into this software , which i think had originally developed his son , and he made this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there are little four-corner , little boxes .
i want to close -- yes , make a beautiful website . how could i also say you don &apos;t make a beautiful website ?
now you ask the linked data that you &apos;ve put together now : 32 hits , each one of which is a protein with these qualities , and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s the data that &apos;s linked .
all of this will lead to the fact that two million children die less every year , last year than in 2000 .
and if it is , are we ready to collect iterian , give and give feedback , to make sure that the promises really provide results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started drawing and painting .
and that &apos;s exactly what fascinated me to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow walking across the street on the way from bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just the way that we &apos;re trained as people to perceive reality in that way , and that makes the significance .
and they said , &quot; go all right .
can &apos;t you do anything from anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box from the wave cardboard .
because when we see somebody walking by , we see the footprint .
what percentage of it have made out of the foreign direct investment ?
obviously , he served the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so the foreign aid is actually very good to get here to the conclusion , because -- if you think about it , i have come to argue today about the economists that are uncontroversial assumption , most of the things are very beaply accurate .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re now going to be a little bit more technical .
think about toyota .
you can &apos;t click on it , so you accept it , and you find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to agree .
it &apos;s weather television and targeted .
pizza , they recover when they &apos;re hungry .
there are millions of different barriers .
so remember , when we think about sexual education and activity , they &apos;re out of baseball .
it &apos;s the poet yuan chen , and it goes like , &quot; i can &apos;t have the bamboo mat .
and it &apos;s , &quot; how much of the day do you think about this person ? &quot;
in over 175 societies , people have left the products of this powerful brain structure .
they came home with 60-80 percent of the dinner table .
and it really became a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are more faithful than women ? &quot;
at no time on this planet , women were so educated , so interesting , so able .
she &apos;s 23rd . she &apos;s been here since she was 13 .
i started to make a decision about why you fall in love with one person rather than in the other .
they &apos;re going to be long as long as the human race is on what shakespeare called this mortal spiral .
but unfortunately , i know .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should be wondering if it could be that insulin resistance is the cause of weight gain and obesity conditions -- at least in most people ?
others , it &apos;s too much food fat .
peter attia : what if our views about diabetes were wrong ?
my great-grandfather , henry ford , really believed it was the mission of ford motor company to improve people &apos;s lives and make cars affordable for everybody .
and the good news is that today we &apos;re packing on the big problems of cars and the environment -- not just at ford , but overall as industry .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we will have when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need an infrastructure that is able to support this flexible future .
that &apos;s a minute 59th .
i think my mother now says i &apos;m a kind of interior architect .
the nurses have to put data in .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s essential . &quot;
so what did this come out ?
it was great for us too , because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , then , as a student of design high school , i met adults who really believed in my ideas , challenged me and had a lot of cup chai with me .
now it was all about the kids . so we didn &apos;t hesitate .
we basically gave the children a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful pictures for you , for a really good purpose , which is the money you give us , it &apos;s used to buy hearing equipment .
but what i &apos;ve never said , and what i want to do is , in fact , environmental kindness is cool .
so , in a way , summarized in the elegant or alternative product here , which we have generously devastated afternoon , the maxin , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind of sensory experience .
if you think about the change in our society , the train from the land to the cities that took 200 years , the same process occurs in 20 years .
it looked forward , even though these were still unknown .
so for example , we would put the models in an artificial sky .
i think there &apos;s a reduction in 94 percent of the order of 94 percent .
and how do we do a little bit more reader in this growing world , especially in some places i &apos;m talking about -- china , for example , that will build 400 new airports in the next 10 years .
and this is the focus of the 18-minute talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in the positive sense that &apos;s healthy and nurture our well-being ; there &apos;s no appropriate darkness .
in contrast to the first office i showed you at the beginning of the talk , this is a very well-known office building , which is the white-group .
behind you are looking at the seagram building , which later became an icon of modern light design .
i think what you see here is quite amazing -- how much light is punishing in the sky and never reaching the ground .
it &apos;s not very pleasant and comfortable .
they &apos;re not being disturbed anymore .
if our interior minister , like a couple of weeks before , announces a war in a third of india called about 200 districts , which were unregible , he left the topic .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was walking home from the office , i might see a honey bee , or it came to mind : could i be like a honeybee , life would be wonderful .
anil gupta : but what is it used to do ? what was it used for ?
to do what ? to break stones , to dig .
that &apos;s the only place she could express her creativity .
they don &apos;t want a second choice of standards and quality market .
and this is what mansukh bhai prajapati did .
i had to say to my favorite .
mr. kharai , who lives with a physical challenge , is only five inches tall .
assam , kanak goi .
that &apos;s delighted .
this is 3.2 billion people .
or skiing . it &apos;s just fun , and people love to go around and do fun things .
