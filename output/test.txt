you know , one of the great reason when you travel and one of the pleasures in ethnographic research is to live with the people who can still remember the old days , and their past still feel at the wind , they shredded on the rain , they covers in the petals .
just knowing that jaguar shamanes were still traveling beyond the milky way , or the importance of the myths of the inuit still matter , or that in the himalayas the buddhists are still pursuing the breath of dharma , the central picture of the anthropologist .
and of course , we all share the same adaptability .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
we go through initiational rituals .
we have to deal with the dispense disconnect with death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all singing and dancing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of love , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the penan in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo act in haiti , or the warrior in the middle of the northern kenya , the curanderos in the desert , or a carawang in the middle of the sahara month of the sahara .
all these people are teaching us that there are other choices , other ways of thinking , different ways of orientation on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can only fulfill one with hope .
together , the countless cultures of the world form a web of spiritual and cultural life that surrounds the earth and is as important for the probably of the earth as the biological life network that you know as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural web as an ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be defined as the sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , inspiration and intuitions that have been defined by the human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are able to do as an amazingly good-looking species .
and just like the biosphere was carried strongly , this happened with the ethnosphere -- just at an even greater speed .
no biologist would argue , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are about extinct , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the most apocalyptized scenarium in the field of biological diversity -- is almost almost almost the case of optimistic diversity in the world .
and the key indicator for that is the extinction of languages .
when each of you were born in this room , there were 6,000 languages on earth .
now a language is not just the sum of the vocabulary or a series of grammashes .
one language is expression of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture can find access to the physical world .
every language is like an elderly forest of the mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6,000 languages today , while sitting here in monterey , just half of them are no longer being whisped into the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught kids anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually already dead .
what could be more lonely than being surrounded by the silence , to be one of the last of your people talking to your language , not having an opportunity to pass the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect the hope of hope ?
and yet , this horrible destiny actually goes somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly man dies and takes the last silver of an old language with himself to the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; would the world not be a better place if we all talk one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let this language be yoruba . let them be canesian .
let them be kogi . &quot;
and then you would suddenly see what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so today , i &apos;d like to take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a quick journey through the ethnosphere , to try and figure out what was actually lost .
now there are some of us who are , in a sense , that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really different possibilities of being .
take this kid from the barasana , for example , in the northwest of the amazon , the anaconda people believe that they have come up with the milky flow from the east in the belly of holy snakes .
this is a people that doesn &apos;t cognitively distinguish between the colors blue and green because the celestial scene is the forest that people depend on .
they have a strange language , and a marriage prescription called the linguistic exogamy : you have to marry someone who speaks a different language .
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , which is the curious thing about these big houses where , because of the missile , six or seven languages , but that you never hear somebody who learns a language .
you just listen and then start speaking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that was first contacted in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionary were trying to connect , and made a profound mistake .
they threw shiny photos from the air , which we used to be a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
they lifted these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see the face or the character , nothing and concluded that this was the business cards of the devil , and they killed the five missionaries with the spears .
but the waorani didn &apos;t just kill outsiders with the spear .
they went through each other .
54 percent of deaths happened by drilling through drill .
we followed geneaology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people a little bit about it , they assumed that one of the people was so old that he died because of his age , and we were still killing him with the spears .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
their hunters were able to smell the urine from 40 steps &apos; distance , and determine what animal species of this animal species was .
in the early 80s , i got a really astonishing assignment when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in going to haiti and filling secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier and tonton macoutes and the venom to make it safe .
and to give you a sense of that , of course , i had to make a little bit about this remarkable belief in the vodoun , and voodoo is not a cult of black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to count the great world treligions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaism , or whatever .
a continent will always be left out , because the assumption was that in sub-saharan africa there was no religious belief . of course , there was one and voodoo is just the overwhelming of these very profound religious thoughts that came during the tragic diaspora of slavery time .
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this alive relationship between the living and the dead .
the living bears the ghosts .
the ghosts can be charged by under the great water , answer to the rhythm of the dance to deny the soul of the living , so the akolyth of the short glary moment to god is going to become god .
and the voodooists like to say , &quot; your white is going to the church and spreads about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be taken by the mind . how can you get damage done ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo acolythen in a trance-state , the glowing coal without combustion , an astonishing demonstration of the capacity to influence the body that it will occur when it &apos;s replaced in a state of extreme repair of affairs . &amp; gt ; i &amp; gt ; i &amp; gt ; i &amp; gt ; i &amp; gt ; i &amp; gt ; i &amp; gt ; i &amp; gt ; i &amp; gt ; i &amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; i &amp; gt ; i &amp; gt ; i &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; em &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , of all the people i &apos;ve met were the kogi from the sierra nevada de santa marta in northern colombia , the most extraordinary .
offspring the old tyrannian civilization , populated the caribbean coastal level of colombia , and as a result , that people moved into an oiled volcanic massif , which goes up over the caribbean coastal level .
in a bloodshed continent , these people were the only ones that were never conquered by the spain .
until this day , they are governed by a ritual priesthood , but the training for the priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young acolyths are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a shadow world of finstar , in stone hills , the glaciers , for 18 years , and two periods of time by their mother , are pointing their pregnancy for the nine months .
and throughout that time , they are culturally inserted into the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological balance -- balance .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you will suddenly take it out one day and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you &apos;ll see a sunset . and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to shine the beautiful landscape .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call themselves the older brothers , and they say that we are the younger brothers , responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think of built-in and landscape , we either rousseau and the old framework of the noble wild , which in its simplicity is a segregated thought , or on the other hand , and they say that people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , native people are not sentimental , nor will they be picked by nostalgia .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for this in the asmat grandeur winds or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have , through time and ritual , a mystery nimbus of the earth that doesn &apos;t have a sense of their minds , but can be close to the earth .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid of the aspiration grows up believing that the mountain is a apu-mind that determines your destiny , will be a very different person , and a different relationship to this resource or this place , as a small child of montana , is growing up with the hill .
whether it &apos;s an insurgency place or a bunch of errors , it &apos;s irrelevant .
and what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the forests of british colombia , and i believed that these forests are there to be saved .
that made me a different person as my friends , under the kwakiutl , who believe that these forests are the restorative place of hukuk and the curved hippedal rail and the cannibali spirits , who are at the north of the world , in their hostile .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , such as this plant here .
it &apos;s a picture i just took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard of , the strongest psychoactive repertoire of the shame .
but what ayahuasca makes so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this preperate , but it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this cave approximate that makes a series of dysfunctionals in the harmin the harmin the harmin the carcines that are made of a rubelt that are made of a rubelt that are made of a rubella piece of a rubble carnic rubelt that are made of a piece of a rubelt that are made of a rubelt that are made of a piece of a rubella rubella rubella rubella rubella rubella rubella rubble carnic pic pic pic pic pic pic pic pic pigeon the carnic pic pic pic pic pic pic pic pic pire , but the body that are actually carnipin the carnipin the carnic pic pic pic pic pic pic pigeon the carnic pire , but the carnic pile .
this plant contains some very strong tryptamins that are very similar to the serotonin , dimethyltryptamin 5 and methoxydimethylyptamin .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanomami , as you will nudge this stuff , this substance that you make of different species has also called methoxydimethydiyptamin .
and to shoot this powder is sort of like being charged out of a gun course , surrounded by baroque paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not produced any distortion of reality , it &apos;s the resolution of reality .
i even experienced with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who introduced the psychedelic erea with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 300s , there was no more to detect that this tryptamine was not a hallucination in the same way .
but the thing about tryptamins is that they can &apos;t be accommodated by a one in the human gut , of course , called monoamin xidase , they &apos;re denatured by a monoamin oxidase .
they can only be used in relation to some other chemicals that denate the mao .
now the intriguing thing is that the tanks contained in liane , that are mao-inhibitors of exactly the same way that you need to potentize the tryptamine . so , ask yourself .
how can these people come from a flora of 80,000 types of addressing plants , find these two morphologically unrelated plants , which , if in this way , create a kind of biochemical version , so the whole greater than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , attempt and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but when you ask the indians , they say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , who you all recognize at a distance in the forest that appears to our eyes as a species .
and then you ask them , how do they create their taxonomy , and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re hiding some plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out that you take each of the 17 variants at whole moon and you sing them in a different sound location .
now , this doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than stamina to count .
now , the problem is that even those of us , who have the sympathy for the difficult state of innate , look at them as orginial and colorful , but somehow restricted on the past , while the real world , d.h. our world continues .
so , the fact is , in 300 years , you will remember the 20th century , not for your wars or your technical innovations , but rather than an era in which we were admitted and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth is either accepted or accepted the problem .
all cultures have participated over and over again with new enhancements .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
the sioux indians didn &apos;t have to be less on sioux than they were fooling and arrow assignment when americans stop being an american interrogated by the horse and horse trucks .
not change and technology threatened the integrity of the ethnosphere . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you look in the world , you &apos;ll find that these cultures are not indoors to the decrease , and these are dynamic living peoples whose existential powers have been displaced in the south world , and the equivalent of their contaminants that are going to the contaminants for the contaminants that are in the contaminants of the contaminants that are in the contaminants that are in the preceding the contaminants that are in the contaminants of the contaminants that are actually going to a marinants that are in the contaminants that are in the marinants that are in the contaminants that are in the contaminants that are in the contaminants that are actually going to the south than the south than the south polinding the contaminants that are in the contaminants that are in the contaminants that are in front of passing the south sea are in front of the contaminants that are in front of the south polarities of the south sea are actually going to a marinants that are in the contaminants that are in the contaminding the south .
or if we go to the hills of tibet , where i study a lot recently , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people is widely convicted , but the ethnocid , the destruction of human life , is not only convicted , but in general , celebrated as part of a developing strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced it at the bottom level .
i once traveled with a young colleague 6,000 miles of chengdu in western china through southeast tibet to lhasa , and only when i first came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you hear . 6,000 sacred monuments that have been turned into fills and the 1.2 million people .
the father of this young man was identified as the tag of the panel lama .
this meant that it was instantly killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle flew with her holiness in the diaspora that brought people to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned as a punishment for -- to be wealthy for crimes .
he was smuggled into prison at the age of two to hide under her rock chalk , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister who did this brave act was brought to an educational camp .
and one day she stepped out of vertebrae on a armband of maos and for those surveys , she had to go into a serious job camp for seven years .
the suffering of tibets can be intractable , but the marginal mind of human beings is something unforgettable .
and in the end , we really stand in front of a choice . do we want to live in a monotony world , or in a polychromatic world of diversity ?
margaret mead , who said great anthropologist before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that as we move towards a thread , stuffy , general view , we not only have the entire bandwidth of the human imagination decreased in a way of thinking , but we &apos;ve forgotten out of one day .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that maybe our species has existed for 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment the cult of the saate corn , put the poetry of the shame through the prose of priesthood , and hierarchy , specialization and over-shooting , only 30 years ago , instead of the prietitutoring revolution . &amp; gt ; / 10-doodle revolution , just 30 years ago . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; em &amp; lt ; em &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / 10-30 years ago ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ;
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges we face in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these countless world cultures for the importance of being human , they will respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the possibility of being what we are : people with full consciousness who are aware of the importance of all people and gardening a space to be enriched . and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a picture i took on the northern end of the baffin islands , when i went to the narwhal-jagd , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government has not always been very good with the inuit and , during the 50th years of the admission of our dominance , they were forced to move in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family that was scared of his life took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that inuit is not scared of the cold ; they used it to their advantage .
the same sketches of their sled were originally made out of fish that was embedded in carbu-skin .
the men &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the blowing storm .
he hatched outside , put his pants down from the sea and-fur and then defeated it in his hand , and when the feces started freezing , he shaped them into the shape of a knife .
he sprayed saliva on the sides of the federal messer , and when it was completely frozen , he amazed a dog with it .
he convicted the dog and improvised a dish , took the skeleton of the dog and improvised a terrible dog , put another dog over the pig of the ice collar with the colorful knife on the belt .
this is not something you can do .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of inuit and all born people in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit back in april , 1999 , the full control over an area bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavut .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the minerals .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can search and achieve regusting with its inhabitants .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not even away at all .
you &apos;re the countries of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that go back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children become , like the dreams of our own children , part of the geography of hope .
what we end up trying to do at national geographic is we believe that politicians will never achieve anything .
we believe that polemics -- we believe that polemics is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million hits a month .
156 nations send our television channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we have a series of travels to the ethnosphere , where we take our audiences to places of such cultural wonders that it can be dedicated by the well-being of anthropology , and hopefully one of the other is going to be able to embrace the most cultural illness of the world that it can exist in a very different way that it can exist in a life-made of a life-sense of any other people can be in the bias an opportunity to be in the bias a life-sense of the world . &quot; world . &quot; bias an opportunity for any other main case of the world . &quot; of our lives in the world can be in any other people can be in any other main case of the world . &quot; of our lives in the bias an opportunity to be in the world can be in the world . &quot; way that we can be in the bias an imprologic way that we can be in any other than any other than any other than any other people are in the world can have a life-mindelected : that we can have a life-minded way that we can be in our lives in the most lives in the world . &quot; of the most cultural illuminous way that we can have an opportunity to embraced way .
thank you .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of an exception just a year ago , which is seadragon . and it &apos;s an environment where you can either reach local or remove large amounts of visual data .
we see lots and lots of gigabytes on digital photos here that you can get seamlessly and advanced , turn around , in any way , to rearrange .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at is how large these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photos of a camera , but this is , for example , a scan of the library of congress , and it &apos;s in a range of 300 megapixels .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the performance of a system like this can be constrained is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-image data .
this is bleak house of dickens . each column is a chapter .
in order to prove that it &apos;s really about text , and it &apos;s not a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of the texts , and it &apos;s not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistically case . this is a copy of the guardian .
each great picture is the beginning of a section .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real paper issue or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did something on the corner of this particular piece of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we &apos;ve added extra content to it .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really reaches these ideas to dissect these constraints for the disposable space on the screen .
we hope that this is not a pop-ups and other nonsense anymore -- that should not be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area as well .
but these are all roads in the u.s.
there is a congregation on the penetrated image of nasa .
now let &apos;s get something else out .
now this is actually live on the internet . you can check it out .
this is a project called photosynth that really connects two different technologies together .
one is seadragon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , who &apos;s noah snave , a university student at washington , under the counseling of steve seitz at uw .
and rick szeliski of microsoft research was done -- a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that , if we can create this kind of views where we can go through pictures and do this experience of multiple resolution .
but the spatial order of images is actually important here .
the computer vision algorithms have held these pictures together to make the real space , where these photographs were all made around the grassi lakes in the canadian rockies , so you see elements of stabilized slides or panorical imaging and all of these things being thrown together .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
there are some that are much more spatial .
i &apos;d like to just walk through one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , photosynth technology , and it &apos;s not so obvious to the website .
we had to worry about lawyers and so forth .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre dame , that included only within the computer with flickr , just give notre dame in flickr , and they &apos;re going to receive images of men in t-shirts and on the universities , and so on , each one of these guys .
so these are all flickr pictures , and they &apos;re all in this room in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
. you know , i never believed that i was going to work at microsoft eventually .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
. i suspect you can see that these are many different types of cameras : everything is about the game camera to professional slrs , a fairly large number of them that have all been put together in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
many of you are covered in faces and so forth .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , which was recorded correctly .
we can move from a poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can put things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all of the collective stores of what , visually , the earth -- and everything is linked to each other .
all of these photographs are connected , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that emerges from all of the earth .
think of this as the continuation of stephen lawler &apos;s work on virtual earth .
and this is something that grows through the complexity that people use , grows and uses that use to use the user , will always wider on the application .
their own photos are being rescued with metadata that another person has put in .
if someone has taken the trouble and shares all of these sacred crafts and shares who you are all , then my photo of the notre dam cathedral will suddenly enrich with all of this data , and i can use it as a starting point to dive in this space , and to dive into this kind of metaphor .
and of course , byproduct of all of these are the immense virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that are not only maintained by overflight or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
i understand them right ? their software makes possible that at a certain point , within the next few years , all the images that somebody in the world are being used together in a context ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t matter to discover anything else .
if you want to make a hyperlinks between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the abundance of the semantic information that many of these images have .
how if you take a websearch for images , where you put sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what image is .
but what if the picture is linking them to all their pictures ?
then the amount of semantic connection and the abundance that comes from it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
blaise , this is really incredible . cardiac congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book that i hope to do with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all the western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like this : if our goal is to maximize the maximizing of our citizens , it &apos;s mainly going to be about the maximizing of freedom .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , meaningful , a forceable premise for the human .
when people have freedom , each of us is about ourselves to do the things that maximize our commons , and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices you have people , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more common you have .
this is , i think , such deep in our water supply , that it &apos;s not going to make any sense of it .
and it &apos;s also rooted deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what &apos;s enabled us to modern progress .
this is my supermarket . not a big one .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing .
there are 175 dresings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different extra olive olives and 12 balsamico-essig you could buy to make a huge number of own salad dessings in the unlikely case that none of the 175 in charge of them is right .
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is like .
and then you go to the consumer electronics store to put together a stereo plant -- loudspeaker , cd player , a cassette player , radio , more pronounced , and in this electronics business , there are so many stereo .
we can put 6.5 million different stereo together from the components that are offered in this one business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have any phone provider as long as he came from ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
now we have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- mp3 player , nasa-hair-trimmer and crème brlée fackel .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this in your business yet , you can be sure that you will soon be .
and what it does is it makes people walk into business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more significant than purchasing objects , the same explosion of choice is the same explosion .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells them , we could do a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks , and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were me , doc , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it patient autonomy . it sounds like a good thing , but reality is a shift from the load of responsibility for making someone who knows something -- namely the doctor -- and someone who doesn &apos;t know anything that &apos;s clearly sick and is not in the best position .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for prescription medications for people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why are they advertising around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , they &apos;re expecting us to call the doc the next morning and ask for a change in prescription .
something as profound as our identity now is a question of the choice of how this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t make an identity , we invent it .
and we reinvent ourselves as often as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one , and that they got as fast as they could , and then as quickly as children could .
the only real choice was , &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
nowadays , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re busy other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married now ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i have children , or should i have a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all asking questions .
and you will answer these questions regardless of whether that means to do all the tasks that i &apos;m going to teach you and not get a good note in my course .
and in fact , you should do that . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl pointed out , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day from every place on the planet -- all the way to the randolph hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell you about that i &apos;m not going to work on the vertebrae .
i &apos;m not going to tell you this because i want to use it .
so what it means is that we have this incredible freedom of choice in terms of making decisions on work , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our kids playing football , and we have our cell phone on the hip , and our blackberry at the other hip , and probably our laptop on our lap .
and even though they &apos;re all turned off , every minute in which we take our child to chairing a soccer game , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i embrace this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of the football game of your child that has been very different from it .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in looked like this .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not all was a matter of choice .
and the world we live in now looks like this .
and the question is , is that good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to get what &apos;s bad about it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradoxically , it &apos;s paralyzed instead of free .
with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this , a study of investing in volunteer age care .
a colleague of mine had access to the investment records of vanguard , the giant fund society of about a million collaborators and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investment fund that was offering employer , participating in two percent .
they &apos;re offering 50 investment onds -- 10 percent less employees participate than if they were only going to offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment onds that are on a selection , it &apos;s so hard to decide which one should choose to put it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course never comes .
you understand that this doesn &apos;t just mean that people have to eat food food food food in their retirement because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means making decisions so hard that they &apos;re adding large investment taxes of their employers .
by which they don &apos;t participate , they give up to 5,000 dollars a year on the employer who would have been happy to raise their contributions .
paralysis is a series of too many choices .
and i think it tends to make the world look like this .
you really want to make the decision right if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or at all the wrong salatdressing .
so this is the one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less pleased with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is obtained by the large choice of diverse salatdresses , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what ssalatdressing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to have made a different decision that would have been better . and what &apos;s going on it ?
the more possibilities there is , the easier it is not to regret at all , that &apos;s disappointing for the choice that you make .
secondly , what economists call oppertunity costs .
dan gilbert made a big point this morning by telling us how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare it .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about it , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternatives that you conclude that makes you less pleased with the alternatives you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my neighborhood in my neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought he followed that he has missed the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking lot .
oppertunity costs down happiness that we get through our selection , even though what we &apos;re looking for is fantastic .
and the more opportunities for selection , the more attractive features of this selection will be considered in the oppertunity cost .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he &apos;s making a statement about it now , and maybe doing things slowly .
but one important thing that he does is always who you choose for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things might have a lot of attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be doing what they &apos;re going to do less attractive .
third , escalation of expectations .
this hit me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only a kind of jeans , and they bought them , and they fused badly , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if they carried them long enough and they &apos;d often bathed enough , they &apos;ve begun to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
so , to buy new jeans after many years of trailing the old one , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want snake , slightly leaping or wide ?
do you want to wash buttons or barrel ? rock or acid wash ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
do you want to cut way down at the bottom , cookie , blah blah blah , &quot; and so on , he said .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i would love the way that used to be the only species . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying to try all these damn jeans , and get the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best pasjeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all of these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason i felt worse was , with all these available opportunities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans were going up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when it was only in a way .
when they came in 100 ways , damn , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had gotten to what i expected , and what i had was so disappointing to what i expected .
the add of opportunities in people &apos;s lives inevitably have the expectations that people have about how well those possibilities are going to be .
and that leads to less happiness with the outcomes , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketing knows this because , if you did , you all didn &apos;t know what this is about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that it used to be better than anything was worse than it was anything that was worse , it was possible for people to experience that was a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live in -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best thing you can hope for is things as well as you might expect them .
you &apos;ll never be surprised , because your expectations , my expectations , are home high .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve come from -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographical moment -- which i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
but not always that bad thing .
finally , a series of purchasing a bad seating jeans if there &apos;s only one way to buy is that if you &apos;re unhappy , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one that &apos;s disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also as clear that the answer to this question is : it .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the weak , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of the decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only one , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned the disappointment because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain those experiences themselves , they think it would be their fault .
and so the visual insight is that we are generally better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma that we all think is right , it &apos;s completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that much choice is better than choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed that dot for a long time on selecting our public good .
now , as a rule of question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule of question , the thing about thinking about this is that what makes all this choice possible in the industrialized societies is wealth of materials .
there are lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not too much choice .
their problem is they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and angry is that steve levitt told you yesterday about how this expensive and hard not to install car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that you don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they make us worse there .
if something that allowed people to make decisions about our society to make these societies that have shifted too little choice in our society , not only would the lives of people , but our dignity be improved .
economists call this a pareto improvement application .
income distribution is going to make all the better -- not just the poor -- because all of this big choice is plaguing us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , a highly sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this goldfish glass . &quot;
impoverished phantasy , a short-sighted view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i first read it .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came up with , which is the fish know something .
because the truth is that if you break the gold glass , everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the gold glass , everything is possible , you &apos;ll reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everyone needs a gold glass .
this is almost confined with complete security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the handen is a metaphorical gold glass recipe for misery , and i suspect disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects earlier , about the human genome and what that could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get away from digital code into a new phase of biology by designing and building new life .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and do on different levels .
we tried to simplify different approaches to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve digitized virtually 20 years , when we sequenced the human genome , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of computers .
now we &apos;re trying to ask : can we regenerate life , or can we make new life out of this digital universe ?
this is a map of a small organism , mycoplasma geitalium , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve been able to get to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our . trust me , it &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we can one eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that the only way to go forward is to actually synthesize this chromosome , which allows us to variate the individual components , and so ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really large molecules , what has never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inherited chemical material .
our steps in digitization of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but still progressively , and our last point is now going to work on an exponential curve .
we started this 15 years ago .
it actually took a couple of years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together , and we could correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made small pieces , we made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles then were released by the cells and came back and killed e. coli .
i was talking to the oil industry recently , and they were saying that they were actually lighting this model .
they laughed more than they do here .
so we think that this is a situation where the software actually can build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it &apos;s got more than 580,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we could build it in cassemen of the size of the virus that we could variate the size of the tape to understand what the living cell was .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be really miserable .
when we first sequenced the genome back in 1995 , the error rate was between a $ 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 errors when we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go up .
and part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and that have to overlap with other 50-letter pieces to build smaller sub-units to fit them together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements in here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve embedded watermarks .
think about it : we have a four-letter code : a , c , g and t.
the triplets of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s one particular determination for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phrases , thoughts .
at first , we just signed them .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve engineered the pieces so that we could just shatter them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair them and put them together again .
and we started making pieces , starting with stages containing the fif- to seventing letters , put them together to make 24,000-letter pieces to put them back together , up to 72,000 .
in every step , we made these pieces in the surplus so that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process that they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
when we get to these really large pieces -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they don &apos;t just grow in e. coli . it &apos;s surpassing all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we changed other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called homologist recombination , using biology to repair dna that can put together these pieces .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans the three million ratios of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , it all added up again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally dry , they can actually live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life can exist and move in space , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a emotional shot of the molecule that we made using these processes -- actually we just used hefe-mechanisms with the right design of the pieces , we put them in . yeast , and then automatically put them together .
this is not electron microscope , it &apos;s a regular microscope .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope .
this is footage over six seconds &apos; worth .
this is the publication we just finished recently .
this is over 580,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure that has ever been created by humans .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we were to print it with a writing sizes of 10 and without distances , it would bounce it 142 pages just to print out these genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s as easier if you do it in eukaryonts as we are : you just take the nucleus out and you put another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
in archaebacteria , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but it &apos;s only recently shown that one could do a full transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbial species . and as we said , these two are distinct from each other like humans and mice . we gave some extra-genes to take this chromosome out . we put it in enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very astole -- and it -- and it was a lot -- and it was a lot of our cell -- and it -- and it -- and it was a lot of our hand -- and it was a lot -- and it was a lot -- and it was a lot of our hand -- and it was a lot -- and it was a lot of our hand it was a lot of our hand -- and it -- and it -- and it -- and it was a lot of our hand -- and it -- and it -- and it -- and it was a lot of our hand it was a lot of our hand -- and it was a lot of our hand -- and it -- and we put it was a lot of our hand it was a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the chromosome cellphone it -- and we put it -- and we made it -- and we made it -- and we made it -- and we made it -- and we made it -- and we made it .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring the process a little bit further .
that &apos;s the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromosome , or a third of anything , every time thousands of characteristics add to a species in one second .
so , people who think of evolution as a gene that is changed at a point in time have missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called restriction cycles that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve already added .
it was expressed in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so at the end we only had a cell with a new chromosome .
it threw blue because of the genes that we had put in .
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and completely converted into a new species based on the new software that we put into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes changed -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve transformed .
it may sound like genomic alchimy , but we can move the software dna , change things quite dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the genesis -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we might be making a new form of cambrian explosion where there could be massive new species education based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;ve grown from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet have existed for each of the year 1946 ; within 40 years it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge to nine .
we need over five billion pounds of coal , 30-plus billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or replace any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that landed in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electronics industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we are firsthand to firsthand to the limits of biological reality , and in those of our imaginations .
we have technology today because of these fast synthesemethods to do what we call combinatorical genetics .
we now have the ability to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you can imagine making these 20 million different genes or optimizing these processes to make octan or new vaccines , with a small team , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just a few selection . we can select for food ability , production of chemicals or fuel production and so on .
this is an actual design software that we &apos;re working on , where you &apos;re actually going to sit down and you &apos;re designing new species at the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly what the genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fuels of the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve seen corn on ethanol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuels of two and third generation , which are pretty soon going to come out , that will have much higher advertisers , like octan or different kinds of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way that biology will have a huge impact without further improvement in the cost of food or the limitation of its availability is when we see co2 as an output material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go away .
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth , and that &apos;s in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about one-and-a-half miles deep , near virtually coding water temperatures .
it converts co2 in methane under the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
we can study whether we can use stored co2 , which could easily be brought to manufacturing stores , convert the co2 into fuel to power this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- moderate goals like the total petrochemical industry -- exactly , if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a source of energy .
but in the same way , we &apos;re working now to apply the same approaches to the development of vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen it with the flu this year , we &apos;re always out the back of the year , and we have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by making recommending vaccines in advance .
this is what the future might look like with changes can now accelerate the evolutionary tree with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and perhaps eukaryonts .
we are light years from getting people to improve . our goal is just that we have an opportunity to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever done -- 27 kilometers in the diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe -- and that &apos;s up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of these mini-big bang in detectors .
this is what i &apos;m working on . he &apos;s called the atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in the diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so that you see the scale .
on september 10 , last year , the machine was on the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused immense jellyfish in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first radial particle that put all the way back to the lhc , then slowly collided with some of the lhc , to drag a rain of particles onto the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest rebel , or this , when someone came to the google side and found the front page like this .
it means that we have a cultural impact besides the scientific achievement .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires -- these gold wires here .
these wires derive 13-thousand amps when the machine &apos;s on high-performance .
now , the engineers of you will look at you and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
they can afford it because if you cool them down very far , they become something called superconductors .
so , at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , these wires can hold the tension .
in one of the compounds between over neunthousands of magnets in the lhc , there was a manual defect .
and by doing that , the wires immediately heated , and 13-thousands of amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of this is even more powerful if you can imagine that the magnet weighs over 20 tons and shifted by about 30 centimeters .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we were doing as well .
we repaired them , we repaired them .
now they &apos;re all back on their way .
by the end of march , the lhc will be again functioning .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and expect to be able to collect first data in june or july , and we &apos;re continuing our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a kind of distinguished accidents like this , the debate recalibrates the value of science and engineering at such limits . it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we reach beyond our limits is the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to an english scientist . humphrey davy , who , i guess , when he defended the useless experiments of his teaching , his apprentice was michael faraday saying , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the evolution of the human mind .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s , of course , more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that this will ever change .
however , shortcuts have occurred a little strange thing in my life and my career that has given me to completely rethink my reference to this work .
now , this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called <UNK> eat , pray , love <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that , in other words , decided not as all of my previous books were going out into the world and became a big mega-event , international bestseller thing .
the result is , no matter where i &apos;m coming , i &apos;m being treated as if i &apos;m refused to the demise .
seriously -- the demise refers !
for example , they come quite concerned to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you will never overcome that success ?
don &apos;t you be afraid to write your whole life and never create a book that anyone in the world cares ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really courageous .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remind myself that over 20 years ago , when i first told as a teenager that i wanted to be a writer who was faced with the same kind of scary response .
people said , &quot; don &apos;t you fear never succeeding ? &quot;
do you have no fear that excellence kills you defeat ?
don &apos;t you fear you &apos;re going to go through this craft your life and never come out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a spare of disc dreams -- your mouth is filled with the bitter aspiration ?
pretty much like this , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
and i always had that .
and i &apos;m a lot more afraid of things that no one would ever know .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
but when it comes to writing i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently , and i think , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it obvious that someone should be expected to be scared of doing the work that he feels commuting ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative entrepreneurs is that they make us uncertain about the state of mind -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked if he had a fear of being a chemist .
with your chemical block , john -- how about you ?
it just didn &apos;t come in , you know ?
but to be fair -- the chemistry group didn &apos;t get the reputation of centuries in alcohol man-depressed people .
but we writers seem to have this kind of call , but not only the writers , but the creative of all genres , seem to have that call , mentally immensely unstable .
all you have to do is look at the bitter death numbers of really great minds from the 20th century alone that died young and often by your own hand .
and even those who are not actually suicide seemed really neglected by their talents .
norman mailer said before his death in his last interview , every one of my books killed me a little bit further .
it &apos;s an extraordinary statement that you can do about your livelihood .
but we don &apos;t even know when we hear somebody like that , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of statement for so long . somehow we &apos;ve got the notion so evaluating and collective that creativity and suffering are somehow related , and that art -- at the end -- always leads to the secrecy .
the question i want to ask everyone here today is : is this idea completely fine for them ?
do you feel comfortable with that ? because if you look at only one centimeter , i feel comfortable with this notion , i don &apos;t really feel comfortable at all .
i think they &apos;re noxious .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them take over to the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we live our great creative encourage .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start , to sort of download this dark path of assumptions -- especially in the circumstances in which i &apos;m in my career right now .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now on is written by the world when the work that came after the passing success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;ll just say it , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here now -- it &apos;s highly likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that can get somebody to start at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , gin . and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d like to continue doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
so after some time of reflection , i think that to continue to be able to write , i have to design a kind of devastating psychological construct .
somehow , i have to find a way of trying to preserve a safe distance in writing between me and my very natural adhesive about how the response will be written on .
while i &apos;ve been searching for models this past year to do this , i &apos;ve also been searching in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see whether they might have better or sensible ideas about it than we can help do creative risks .
this quest took me to the ancient greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of dieneration spirit , coming from a distant , unknown source to the people -- for unexplained , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these dienery spirits of creativity sovermones .
it &apos;s known by socrates that he believed that he had a twion , and he would share it with it from faraway from farmbones .
the roman had the same idea , they called this kind of body lovely creative mind .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature that believed that it literally lives in the walls of an artist artist &apos;s work -- something like dobby , the household -- the outcome and the artist , in a certain way , dignity , would unseen and the result of the work .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance i was talking about -- the psychological construct , protecting you from the effects of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like that , right ?
the artist of the age was protected with certain things , like , for example , too much narcissm , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t check it all for you , and everybody knew you had this physically disembodied genius that helped you .
if your work flew -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a bit lahm .
that &apos;s how people in the west have really thought about creativity for a long time .
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and this big idea was , let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- all gods and mysteries . and there &apos;s no space for mystic creatures to embrace the advice from the gods .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity was completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , people hear this or the artist call a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think it was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a naked person to allow him to think that he or she is like the vessel and the essence and the source of all the divinity , creative , unknown , infinite mysterium is a little bit too much responsibility to give you a framework for a person of humanity .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
that displaces and shredds whole egos , and it creates all these unaccomplished expectations of success .
i think that this success pressure has defeated our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- the question is .
can we change it ?
maybe a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative world .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just eliminate the thought of 500 years of rational humanism in an 18-minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would raise really adamantly scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically fears that people will follow and apply fatty to their projects , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to throw up is , why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else i &apos;ve heard of when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy capability of the creative process .
a process that , as anyone knows , that has ever tried to do -- in other words , everyone here -- doesn &apos;t always deny them .
in fact , it can feel really straightforward sometimes .
i had this encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who &apos;s now 90 , but her entire life was denser , and she told me that when she was growing up in the villages virginia , she was working on the fields .
she said it was like air thundering train .
the one over the country would roll to them . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
she felt when it came , because it would kill the earth under her feet .
she knew that in a moment , she could only do one , and that was -- in her words -- running like the devil .
she ran like the devil to the house while she was tracked by this poem , and the only thing she did was she quickly had to get enough sheet of paper and a pen , so she could get it through her through thumby-donated , captured and wrapped on the sheet .
in others , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house and the poem rolled through her and she lost it . she said it was going to move across the country , and -- as she said , looking for another poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;ll never forget -- she said there were moments in which they almost miss it .
so she runs to the house and she looks for the paper and the poem goes through them , and she reaches a pencil just as it goes through and then -- she said -- it was like reaching with her other hand , and getting it packed .
she wished the poem on his tail , and then she pulled it back into her body and took it over on the sheet of paper .
in those opportunities , the poem was transformed and intact on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first one .
when i heard this , i thought , this is incredibly peculiar -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
it &apos;s not like my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a political animal . to work , i have to stand up and sweat the same time every day and sweat me and go out and go through really awkward .
but even in my mapping kind of herself , i have gotten up this thing sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas coming through from a source through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s that for a thing ?
and how do we relate to that without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite side of mental health ?
for me , the best living example of how to do this is to make the musician tom waits . i was allowed to interview him for a magazine a few years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the aggregated modern artist , who tried to handle this unchecked creative impulse that lives in him , to dominate and to cope with them .
but then he got older and quietly . he told me that he was driving on a fast-road in los angeles one day , and it changed everything for him .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly sounds a little fragment of a tune that sounds like inspirations a lot of times for him , hardly tangible . and he wants to have them . she &apos;s praying after that , but he can &apos;t touch them .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a tape recorder .
so he starts to climb up this old glue inside him like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be tracked by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not going to make it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
he finished the whole thought , and he did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , &quot; excuse me , can &apos;t you see i &apos;m driving a car ? &quot;
i &apos;m looking like i could just write a song out of it ?
if you really want to exist , come to a cheaper moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , torture somebody else today .
go ahead and quedule leonard cohen .
so his whole process of work changed afterwards .
not the work itself . it &apos;s continue to be as dark as eh and ever .
but the process and the heavy adhesive that surrounds it was lifted up when he took out the genius where he didn &apos;t make anything more painful and got it back to the point where he came from , and he realized it didn &apos;t have to be an inherited , torsing thing .
there could be a peculiar , wonderful , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and stranger , outrageous thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked and it &apos;s been rescuing me once .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the <UNK> eat , pray , love <UNK> . i fell into one of the doubt of the doubt that we all fall in when we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not only bad , but of the worst time .
i started thinking , i should just come in this project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i took my view of the manuscript , and i talked my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i said , &quot; listen , you thing , you and i both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;ve got everything i &apos;ve got , invest . i don &apos;t have that anymore than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to cruise here and maintain your percentage of defecation .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the devil is .
i &apos;m going to keep writing though , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to ask you to protocol , i &apos;ve been here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... and at the end , it &apos;s like this . centuries ago , people in the deserts of north africa have gathered into moonlight fears with holy dances and music that have been withdrawn on for hours -- to the dawn of dawn .
these fests were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , very rarely , something special happened , and one of the performers actually got oversecular .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that all of you in your life have seen such a performance .
it was as if the time was still , and the dancer walked through a kind of embarrassed , and he didn &apos;t do anything different than he &apos;d ever done before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything was added together .
and all of a sudden it didn &apos;t seem to be human any longer .
it was lit up by the inside and illuminated from the bottom , and everything was illuminated through a divine fire .
when something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it on his name .
they put the hands together , and they started singing : <UNK> allah , allah , allah , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical footnote : when the species conquered south spain , they brought this practice . the language changed over the centuries of <UNK> allah , alla<UNK> allah , alla<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> olé , olé , olé , you &apos;re still listening to flame and fungs .
if a doctor in spain has done something impossible , a magical thing : <UNK> allah , olé , olé , allah , great , bravo outrageous , it &apos;s -- a fleeting glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but the one tricky part follows the next morning , if the dancer woke up himself and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and no longer a fifth of god carries .
it &apos;s just an aging mortar with painful knees , and maybe it &apos;s never going to go up to those altitudes .
and maybe somebody &apos;s never going to call out god &apos;s name if he turns . but what &apos;s he going to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful corrections of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pine , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
if you may only believe that you are a loan -- of an unbelievable source for a reader time of your life , passed on to somebody else , if you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it this way , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think with safety over the past few months , while i was working on the book that will soon seem -- as the dangerous , scary , strongly expected success of my driving success .
what i have to always tell myself , when i get mad about this , is , don &apos;t fear .
don &apos;t be discouraged .
just make your job .
be there for your contribution , whatever he wants to be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius , which you &apos;re on the side , decides , for a brief moment , there &apos;s also a miracle to show through your effort , it &apos;s olé !
and if not , then dance your dance , anyway .
and olé ! <UNK> <UNK> all this stuff .
i believe in it , and i have the feeling that we should teach that .
olé ! for all of this , just for having the naked human love and the meaning of being there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , which was the size of the bottom 48 states , had shrunk by 40 percent .
but that doesn &apos;t really expresse enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic ice caps is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in the winter and it shrinks in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a time-lapse recording of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
the continuous ice is labeled with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s dependent on the dark blue . this is the annual ice in winter , and it &apos;s shrinking in the summer .
it &apos;s called thumb ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood flowing out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will have gone from here to here .
this is a problem because warming gives up the frozen reason for the arctic ocean where there are large amounts of frozen carbon , which , if you &apos;re looking at microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of climate change in the atmosphere , this amount could double if we transcend this critical point .
already in some lakes in alaska methane today , put themselves out of water .
professor katey walter at the university of alaska has traveled to another sample to another flat sea last winter .
wow !
you can do it well . the question is , how is it going to make us go ?
and one of the reasons is this enormous warmth warming greenland from the north .
this is an annual flow of water .
but volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the canosuaq flow in southern west greenland .
if you want to know what the sea level is going through land ice sheet , it &apos;s going to float here in the ocean .
these rivers are adding rapid .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest ice mass on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has now a negative ice cream .
and the west antarctica that &apos;s popped up over a few underwater islands is especially in melting .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see on top of new lakes that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting water .
in the angles , this glacier is the drinking source for this city .
the amounts of water have been expanding .
but if you seduct , most of the drinking water is falling away .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of the snowflake of the sierra .
this is the basin of memory .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
this estrogen all over the world leads to a dramatic stickness of fire .
and the disasters all over the world have declined in a really marvelous extent and have never attributed before .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 750s .
this is a completely unsustainable development pattern .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we have produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons a day in the oceans .
look carefully at the realm of the eastern pacific , from the american continent west and both out of the indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a dramatic decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the largest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
the united states is one of the most pollutants , along with china .
and the proposal was to build many more coal factories .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here are the ones that have been argued in the last few years with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
of course , there &apos;s a political dispute in our country .
and the coal dustries and oil dustries have spent a quarter billion dollars in last calendars to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this image reminded me of something .
christmas was walking around at home in tennessee , a billion tons of coal lamb .
you saw it in the news , apparently .
this is in our entire country of second-largest abundance in america .
this happened around christmas .
one of the commercials of coal industry at christmas was this one .
frosty the carbon man is a pleasure , joyful bursche .
it &apos;s in shell and abundance in america , and it &apos;s helping our economy grow .
frosty , the carbon man becomes clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and loving , and workers remain in wage and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful mining workers is the leader of massey coal .
let me say one thing . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has set two campaigns .
this is one , part of it .
in coalergy , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we sat it down to the top line , spend a sizable money money in order to get an action on the way to get the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells even good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s keep it quiet .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean cow factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean cohletechnology .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable coal technology that you see here changes everything .
if you look carefully , this is the clean cohletechnology today .
finally , the positive alternative mixes with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects them all is our dependence on carbon fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a courageous , new solution to get ourselves out of that mismatch .
provided america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , make us safer and to help stop global warming .
finally , a solution large enough to solve our problems .
utilities are new . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
one of the fastest ways of decreasing our dependence on old , dirty fuels that are sticking our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and new energy system .
new investments to create well-paying jobs .
utilities are new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we have to come a long way , and we have to get fast .
thank you .
i want to start by asking you to rethink of your childhood when you were playing with building blocks .
as they realized how to reach out and grasp the hands , move the bricks and move them , they actually learned how to think and solve problems with understanding and change the contexts .
the spatial thinking is tightly connected to how we understand a lot of our surroundings .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- along with my expert patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i began to wonder : what if we could use computers , instead of a mouse line , which would be like a fingertip on the surface ...
so this question was so stunning that we decided to explore the answer and build siftables .
in short , a siftable computer is an interactive computer the size of a cone .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can grab your movements , and you have a screen and you have a radio receiver .
more importantly , are physically , why you can only move them , like building blocks , through extending your hands and reaching .
and the offenders are an example of a new generation of aid to manipulation digital data .
and if these tools are going to be physical and develop an awareness of their movements , recognize each other and perceive the enemies of our effort with them , then we can start to explore new and entertaining types of interactions .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this siftable is directed for the video review , and if i stick it in one direction , the video will be played forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits are each other &apos;s true .
so if i put them together side-by-side , that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the native , you &apos;ll notice this as well , and you can get a little nervous .
and they also feel their movements and their tendency .
now , an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like shooting colors in the way you do it with fluids .
in this case , we have three siftables as color pots , and i can use them to pour color in the middle where they &apos;re then mixed .
if we overdo it , we can take a little back .
there are also some kind of nice opportunities in education like languages , math or logic games , where we give people the possibility of the rapid process , and we want to see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series , which i do with a simple equation program .
this is a game with words that &apos;s kind of a mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , you get every round on every siftable randomness of letters , and as you try to form words , they are reviewed through a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , you mix again , and you have a new letter combination and new opportunities to try .
thank you .
these are some kids who came to the media lab on a trip , and i was able to move them to try and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
a more interesting thing about this kind of applications is you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; forming words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
so here &apos;s a couple more people trying to test it .
this is our youngest beta-tester down there on the right .
it turns out he wanted to just stack the siftables .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
this is an interactive trickfilmmaking .
we wanted to develop a language learner .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by picking up the siftable from the table that shows this character .
here it lets the sun rise .
the sun rises .
now he &apos;s going to take a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the six-ables , and by the way , he is able to let the characters interact ...
... invent his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with the obvious end , and it can decide how it evolves .
flying cat .
the last example that i have time for today to show it is a musical sequencer for live uprising that we &apos;ve recently developed and in the siftables as a sound , like leadership voice , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can select which one wants to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can then arrange in any pattern .
and you restore them by just holding a ton-siftable to a sequencing agent .
there are effects that you can change live , like reverberation and filter .
you put it in a particular tone , and then it tends to hire it .
and then arranged effects like tempo and volume that you &apos;re using on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start to feed the lead voice in two sequence-siftable , put them in a series , extend it and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do some more drums on this .
and now i &apos;m going to combine the filter with the drums so i can direct the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by blowing the pace into one or the other .
and now i &apos;ll compensate the filter with the barrel ; i &apos;ll leave you with a little bit more expression .
i can change the sequence as it passes .
and by doing that , i don &apos;t have to plan it in the field , but i can improvise ; it &apos;s handicasting or crashing it in the meanwhile .
and finally , i can shut out the whole sequence by ending the volume enhancing stronger license to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new human-computer intersections that adapt better to how our brains and bodies work .
and today i &apos;ve had time to show you some of the new design world and some of the ways that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you with is that we &apos;re at the threshold of this new generation of adversarities to interacting with digital media , bringing information into our world that demands our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to all of you !
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very pleased to be there .
yes , so what should be biohacking ?
i just have to get a little bit out of that , and that &apos;s biohacking dealing with modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been involved with the biohacking for a few years now , and i &apos;ve started this because i just wanted to know precisely , and i wanted to do it myself , most importantly , what i &apos;ve learned in the study .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to the matter , like that .
i think that molecular biology , in general now , is generally speaking biotechnology , everything you count to synthetic biology and so on .
what &apos;s really important now is extremely important , and even more , much more important is going to be in the future .
there are as controversial things as all of the genetically altered plants in the pockers .
there are now craig venter in the u.s. a trying to make biofuel , so gasoline from algae .
among them , there are things that have come totally in everyday life , but most people are not aware of , for example , washing enzymes that allow us to wash at 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetic optimized enzymes .
and you can continue the list endlessly .
and so from the interest in this technology , i &apos;ve just moved on to this technology .
so what about hacking now ?
most people know this from the software level .
computers hack , and then in the media it always gets like this , yes , the hackers break somewhere and clap data and so on .
now , this is kind of very sad for the hacking scene , because it &apos;s not true what it actually started , and what &apos;s really going on behind it .
and that &apos;s where the software hackers started in the &apos; 70s , eighty years of computer boards , and that &apos;s what the internet was made out of it as well . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and it &apos;s about solving a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and the problem is that it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a problem that can be just like things , so any problem is to pick up a question , and how can you do it differently or how to do it better .
and it &apos;s just become generated with software , but there &apos;s an electronics field , there &apos;s also a whole field of build-up scene making electronics circuits all kinds of drilling things .
and now there &apos;s also biology , and i want this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a science of information , because the d.n.a code is an abstract code , which is not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s dynamic matter , and it &apos;s not just because it &apos;s cyber matter .
but it &apos;s also a code , and it &apos;s also possible to code , and so you can actually hack it , like this , and i find it incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get much deeper into it .
this has actually taken two thousand quite eight really a form , these networks .
there &apos;s hackteria dot org , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with a cooperation in india based network , but by now members or active people around the world .
that &apos;s got more artistic directions , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers working with scientists , looking at them , interfering with these technologies and asking questions and doing this creative work , and there &apos;s museum exhibitions , and there &apos;s all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s really always about trying to find such a dazzling approach , such a playful way of having that kind of thing with it . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself bio dot org , d.i.y.bio .
this is a network from the u.s. a , which is actually more of a form where you &apos;re making a halt and discussing online .
they &apos;re kind of teemed up some technical , and they &apos;re also sort of a businessman along the way , and then they &apos;re asked , you know , turned questions .
and based on these networks , which have made the whole popular , has evolved such a scene that i &apos;d like to portrait for a moment .
here in the image on the upper left is biocurious , this is a hackerspace , so basically a school , such private school , a private school , a non-profit facility where everyone can go .
kids , old , all sorts of people go there to just sit apart with this , and they set up a lab and look at what you can do if these lab protocols .
down here on the left is a group in indonesia , house-of-natural-fiber , which is , but it &apos;s been around for quite a long time .
for more than those other two networks .
they &apos;re also in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , electronics of buildings , and they combine it in a very delicate way .
a group of ankara , which i just met a while ago , which is a group of students who like to go around the public , and they &apos;re learning what they &apos;re learning in college , and they &apos;ve done this on the street little actions , and they &apos;re trying to explain what they &apos;re d.n.n.a .
and i have a lecture in the other image in copenhagen at the medical museum in combination with an exhibition on the topic .
and that is , yes , that &apos;s usually quite young people , but the only thing that really relates to all of you is this fascination of technology .
and what you can do with that , and you can go around the society and ask them , okay , what do you know , what do you want to contribute , do you have an interest in getting you in this way ?
so , o.k , to hack biology now , you kind of need materials .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and that &apos;s then a lab .
or what you normally understand under a lab is kind of sending machines , extremely expensive , extremely distanced for professionals , trained academics with ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was just to say , o.k , that you actually don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary , because every coffee machine that every coffee machine has actually more sophisticated technology than most laboratories , that &apos;s really the way .
and s o with this premise with this premise , for example , brian degger in england tried to put together a minimum abor , then put together a steam printing operation , a hot plate , and , yeah , sweet , and then cultivated bacteria .
so everyone who &apos;s been shredding a soup that he &apos;s given too long , has been done before .
i tried to extend this in my lab at my lab a little bit , and then bought me so second-hand equipment on ebay and do some d.n.a analysis , trying to make a paternity test , so the d.n.d.n.5 fingering , your home .
now this shouldn &apos;t be a joke , but it does .
what you see down here is the lab , in leadership strikes , so it &apos;s such a coated garage with all kinds of lab scaffolding that the university has posted , a group in paris , which has been doing something that &apos;s inherited , and i &apos;m doing some pretty interesting things , as well .
and this is biocuriosity , which you just mentioned hackerspace , this one , this kind of volkshochschool , basically for molecular biology .
and yes , you can see , it &apos;s relatively heterogeneous , so there &apos;s a half of people doing it alone at home , all the way to big organizations that are doing this more formal already in institutionalized form .
but it &apos;s always the idea that it &apos;s going to be easy and accessible .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we were instantly aware of ourselves , o.k , we are now as a real scene , and we are online , and we know the people that are always chatting and so on .
and then just came from the do-it-yourself bio org website , the founder website , and said , o.k , we have to really meet now , also meet real , and then organized two sessions , one in london , two thousand , a thousand , and short afterwards in the u.s. union in san .
and , then there it was , yes o.k , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share with ?
and what are our values and what is our goal , our foundations ?
and then we did a code-of-conduct like this .
that was pretty intuitive , so everyone just had his wishes , his and what moved him , expressed , then .
there , in my opinion , was a very good code .
and then we don &apos;t have that kind of thing , but that &apos;s kind of a good job , i think , has been relatively commissioned , that people are really convinced by this .
and we even tried to put that back into the academic world , but it &apos;s not there in some way .
so i think we &apos;re from the biohacker scene , in fact , a step further than the academic world .
well , what kind of projects do we actually do ?
one project that i did with the hackteria network in switzerland itself was we wanted to create something called the optical trap or optical brass .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , onto a room , so you can catch little particles in the air or in the fluid and then move into that focus , which is then captured like a tractory beam , so it &apos;s kind of captured .
it really works , it &apos;s done in the academic setting , and we thought , o.k , we can get that right , then take a webcam , screwed it up , turn it off lens , but then you have a microscope that &apos;s about four hundred times .
you see that down there .
and then we took a d.v.d brenner apart , and we took the laser out and then tried to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , that didn &apos;t work , but we still learned a lot about it .
this is another project that &apos;s taken out of paris by the french group that &apos;s been working out of paris , and that &apos;s pretty cool .
and he &apos;s got a kind of a you know , such a brain wave device , so e.e.g , or something like that , so he &apos;s been busy neurobiology , his nickname is sam neurohack .
he then built this helmet there , and in the cooperation with the museum , we ran this .
and then the visitors could go in the room , sit on this chair , sit this helmet .
and then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , there are different lights coming in the room .
it was a pretty fortunate project .
another thing from the united states , which has to do with this paternity story there , is the p.cr , which is the polymeraskettic response , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about replicating just genes , replicating , d.n.a , fragments so that you can visually make them visible .
so if i do that now , the profilers at the crime scene , go and collect some hair samples , and then they do this method , and then they can say , o.k , this hair belongs to this person .
and the machines that do this kind of thing are quite expensive to buy commercial , the cheapest ones go in four thousand euros .
and that &apos;s not in the hobbyrealm , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can do very much .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they took two builders , and they said , o.k , we make that easier and cheaper , and then we just got open source , which is free hardware , electronics , all of this device , and they &apos;re now provided to the commercials of the world .
i think , kind of , hour-and-a-half dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s certainly in a context where it &apos;s going to be a plenty available .
so , i think it &apos;s a very promiscuous hack .
a project that i had started to build was a gene-gun lately .
gene-gun , yes , it &apos;s a kind of air printing gun that &apos;s going to shooting about this far , two centimeters or anything .
you invite d.n.a to goldparticles and then the gold particles into this air pressure pistole , and then i shot them on weights , and then they brought them to light .
so the device you see that didn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype , which has looked pretty much down , so on a branch , the thing on it , pushed electronics on it and pressures , but that was the pressure was too high , the thing has broken .
and then i took a juggling pender and graduated from that .
a juggling pender , if you have the full power of water , you have enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s about 40 to six hundred to six .
and so you can accelerate the particles very well enough , and then they go into the onion as well .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euros to upwards or something like that , like 50 thousand euros .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically doable .
so , that is , right now , the core issue of the scene is to increase the availability of technology and also increase the information and understanding that more people can be engaged .
because , as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have very little sense of it , and also no chance of making a really good job .
because , if you just read about it , from secondary english literature , it &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or seen it yourself .
and i think technology is becoming more and more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to , as an informed citizen , be able to make sensory decisions in society and talk to them , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it , in order to make it and understand it .
and this then firms open knowledge and citizen science headquarters .
so you &apos;re just putting yourself in a citizen and trying to deal with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the core issue of the biohackers .
these are the people who have , at least officially contributed on the website , d.i.y.bio-dot-org website .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s also interesting is that they &apos;ve also entered southeast asia .
that &apos;s me , i think , that &apos;s where there are fewer people in it than actually exists .
so i know of some that haven &apos;t carried in .
and these are now just the biohacker , the individual people .
partly with these hackerspaces , so they carried these places together .
and that &apos;s at the very beginning .
as i said , two thousand suspects , it only started .
and hackerspaces , so the computer hackerspaces , because the c-base in berlin was the first , 100-foot substance .
and this has become a giant network of very good , yes , infrastructural centers that have occurred all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re looking a little bit like that , and then very similar to that , so that it &apos;s getting more involved in people .
and i would invite every time to embrace it and also try something .
now it &apos;s not that simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and there &apos;s enough energy in there , then you &apos;ll get there too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work with people ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very much moved as a designer , but also in the field of research and usability , and in front of all things in user experience .
it &apos;s about how to encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , and in order to give them a very peaceful experience .
because i believe that the interactive media in us are archaic , cognitive models , so the paradigm that we have had had been programmed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can reconcile that right now through interactive media .
and this is quite amazing because you actually believe that this high-technology that you see there is actually going to get you to the future , but in fact , the future is right with us , in our archaic roots .
so what are archaic models now ?
i wrote down four words , and i want to explain briefly .
now archaic cognitive models , which is the models that we have used in the pre-industrial times .
in those archaic models , we &apos;ve heard that we have a principle natural ratio to virtuality .
that sounds , in principle , unusual first .
but i &apos;m going to go back to that in a minute , and i &apos;m going to show you an attempt that you also have a natural relationship to the virtuality .
the second thing is , since this archaic model , we &apos;ve been able to talk very , very imaginary , even though we &apos;re using a codified language today .
and the third section , which really explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media , by definition , are nonlinear , which includes the sense of linearity , and what of us , of course , is that we feel linearity now as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information delivery .
now , what about the virtuality that &apos;s actually the most natural thing in the world .
i &apos;d like to prove this to you .
how many doors have the house they live in ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer that to me immediately , but this is what &apos;s going to happen and is going to happen right now .
they go through this house in the spirit , so they live in , and they look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re virtualizing reality without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we tire to the media-campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.r.-lab , and we can actually do that all the time .
and this capacity to virtual reality , which has taken people in the pre-industrial times in a bitter , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have photolitography .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their head .
and in that head , the memory was falling off .
so , in this head , knowledge was called , and using these virtual images , the imagination , the only knowledge has been passed on .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so rooted in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
and the interesting thing about this is , if i can take a little trip .
yes , that can be done .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that at that time human beings were also media producers and medium themselves .
now , if you think a piece further .
what is media today ?
and then you &apos;ll notice that there has been a change .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;ll talk about in a minute .
the essence of information medication tool has been on any stories .
shamanas , priests , so-called knowledge waters , were designed to keep knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong with stories today .
the author of the book , the storytelling animal , jonathan gotchin , we &apos;re still connected every year to a hundred hours with the recipe of stories .
this is for a child who has spent most of his life with the recipe for the achievement of the most of his life with the recipe of stories .
now we think our love is related to stories that , as a child , we &apos;ve been searching on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
this goes on a lot further , into the pre-industrial cultures .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , when it &apos;s particularly impressive , we &apos;ve grown up in our biological memory to think of the capacity to do nonlinear .
i brought you an example from the north american tribe of nootka-indians .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very rare area , and you had to kind of navigate there from island to island to get food .
and they &apos;ve done this with what &apos;s called the lead maps .
you may know that as well , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in this , of the australian uranians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lever maps , but they used these nanny sunglines , or grappling times as well .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be carried on songs .
where the language was subordinated by the subordinated rang .
that is , you navigated on sound and about rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm have presented the geology that the topography of a region , and of course that allowed you to fragment these songs and put themselves to the left , to the right , and also to move back to the peer .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from above a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what happened there actually ?
what &apos;s happening is the genetically engineered machine age .
we &apos;ve moved in what we call the vogt age before .
what &apos;s happening is the machine age , and what &apos;s happening is the book , and this is the photolitography .
and that &apos;s what happened is that we have deposited the responsibility for our memories and our own production of our individual memories in external media .
in the book and in the picture .
so , unfortunately , we &apos;ve lost a piece of god too far .
virtuality has become alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality anymore .
bruce brown , a well-known design researcher at brighton-university , has gone so far to say that this mass media , he thinks the book and the picture , not the television , the internet and so on , what we call a mass media today , have memorized our ability .
let &apos;s make a little intermediate .
from the vocal age to the machine age .
what does shock have on our minds and our memories ?
and then these are interconnected influences of pre-industrial cultures .
and they are more and more over-pressed over the course of the centuries by the influences of the machine age .
that is , instead of remembering ourselves individually , we have standardized , widespread patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing ourselves anymore .
we have an abstract language abstract .
we &apos;re not imagining the thing in pictures that things don &apos;t make anymore in pictures , but we &apos;re coding them our language .
we &apos;ve been used to things in linear ways .
and we have accepted linearity as the law , and there are only exceptions , like non-linearity .
what we are left with is the story of the story .
we are still very , very strongly arrested by the story of information as an intermediation of information .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had the vog age , we had the machine age , and we now described the so-called cyber age .
it sounds very spacey , and it sounds like science-fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cyber age that get us to rediscover these possibilities from our capabilities .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearity , it &apos;s about storytelling .
i want to explain this a little bit for a moment .
there are technical concepts like this augmented reality , which is the extended reality .
so if you look at google glasses , for example , then it &apos;s a concept that allows us to recombine the virtual world with the real world , which is called our affinity to virtual , the virtual world as something that &apos;s normal , natural recommendation .
another example is what we call virtual reality .
so this is crazy , of course , in the context of my talk , because we physically move around in no existential , virtual worlds , right after the image of the holodecks .
and other example are the ambients , smart systems .
these are spaces that are being intelligent able to respond to a human .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic capacity for virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve graduated , and i hope the video works , a very beautiful project , which is the bachelorate of michael burk , ann-thrin krence , joris klause and jan-moritz garbage .
and the last two of them are also here today .
maybe you can stand up for a moment , so you can pause with the two of you in the recess with the project .
and i brought this project as an example , again , to this archaic , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say to it .
which , of course , is extremely opposite to the story , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i tell computer games , you might have very likely eyes that any people go around in front of any sort of console or play with those with some console in your hand .
anyway , they do it in there .
this is a game for the outside .
and this is designed to think that i &apos;m discovering the outside world , so i &apos;m discovering the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data to the data space that we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to cut down so much .
and then you can explain that much better , and there &apos;s more to that .
and this is the fact that i discover a city by looking at which places were positive or negative .
and so i get a very different view of the city , a very different sense , which is i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i think , in this way , a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re about to see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk and also in the sense that the characteristics and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the avian age , and the things that we have , in fact , become complex in the machine age , that the help of what we call cy-age , and how we become more complicated , and how we can be able to be able to become more easily activated with these kinds of how we become more sophisticated , in the age , and more complex , and more complex cyber in the age , and how we become more complex , and how we become more easily , and how we can be able to be able to be able to become more sophisticated in the age , and how we can be able to be able to be able to be able to become more sophisticated , and more complex , and how we can be able to be able to become more engineered , and how we become more engineered , and more complex , and more easily known as we can be able to become more sophisticated in the technology . &quot; how we become more complicated . &quot; how we become more complicated . &quot; how we age . &quot; how we become more complicated . &quot; how we become more complicated . &quot; how we become more complex . &quot; how we become . &quot; better .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked if this sack is a speaker and will be speaking to me .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
but i &apos;m just going to do it a little bit curious yet .
yes , kids are naturally out of curiosity or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m , of course , involved in the topic of curiosity , and how curiosity also changes how curiosity we think again , and why we might also lose curiosity and have to reject the usw again and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re looking at besides being a form of being .
when professors get curious , they &apos;re often cleaned into this n research set .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve had over the last half-year .
a research mester on the topic of natural user interface design .
now you &apos;re going to ask , why do all the designers begin to deal with such natural , archaic forms of communication , interaction and so forth .
and i only hold up one of these little devices , because things should become more intuitive , more natural , user friendly , and you have to look , which is , of course , for us human beings , which is user-friendly or intuitive .
and in front of the background , i was design in the realm of natural user interface , so the next generation of the human being , where the human computer is dealing with how our tools or how the computer changes from the computer of sukessive to the digital assistant assistant .
so i &apos;ve been busy on when , of course , that &apos;s what &apos;s intuitive or intuitive .
maybe you have to take a look at this as well .
why is this happening at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , briefly here , then we move from the third to the fourth generation of society or social form .
so from modern in the computer society .
each society is shaped by a primary medium .
in the beginning , the tribal society is through language .
that is , you found that you were talking about a common language , you could communicate with each other , you drawn into the same cave , or you know , you created cities , you created villages , you know , created tribal society in a way .
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very living .
now , you also had to learn , so you don &apos;t have to talk about nature , but we do learn it sucessive and proportionally , of course .
and that was triggered by ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a huge outcry then , because , of course , you started to manifest the living language in the form of writing , which is what fluid and alive , i &apos;m going to take it and i &apos;m manipulating it in stone , and i &apos;m also manipulating it .
depending on my candle and when i cast , it &apos;s a very different narrative than if there &apos;s a alive one , of course .
but sukessive then moved the script as primary medium .
and then the next generation that we &apos;re actually living in today is primarily .
that &apos;s just the print and print script with gutenberg and others .
at the time , it was a monkey , where adel and clerus and others have said , you &apos;re really insane when people start reading , then the afterwards want to talk to you , and that &apos;s totally fatal , of course .
and now we &apos;re coming to the next generation , and the exciting thing is , a change in general is only every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomenal phase right now , that we &apos;re doing something like this .
of course , this confuses us , because we see on the one side of the new media , socil social media , facebook usw and so on .
with total transparency , what the new thinking is , what banged on the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the lasagne horse meat and no beef is a beef or a different phenomenon , which is that i just want to flip this up and i want to do that .
and these two worlds are already growing up , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , it &apos;s a lot of lots of mechanisms , principles and archaic paradigm from the tribal society .
now , not at the local level , but at a global level .
we understood that weather is global .
that the issue of ecology is a global one .
not , if i think of local ecologically , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , the whole doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that is , from the local village , a global village has actually become the same principles , enabling , of course , provided intuitive , but also the total transparency .
so as you knew in the village , who has what happens to whom and when , this is how this is happening today about this extension of our self through these mobile finance devices at a global level .
be that we know more and more and more quickly and more and more aggregate .
as it happened earlier on the village .
now , in front of the background , i &apos;ve just been looking at this , which does it mean , what &apos;s even more natural to us , what might we have lost , but what is it that instinctively , so what makes the difference ?
because people often come , you can &apos;t make it user-friendly , so everyone can deal with it .
so you have to deal with that , which means that , and not only does it change it , it &apos;s different , but it should also be better .
and then , of course , when is an intuitive thing , and how can i take as a form of influence , and then make the things so that they can use a user friendly , so they can be intuitive because then they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re easy to use .
you go busy , even during studying , with the issue of perception and perceptual sychology .
and that &apos;s also , of course , where you start and you look and you say , okay , now i &apos;m just looking in the inner self .
and what does it look like in there actually ?
so how do we work when we look inside this ?
and what does it mean , of course , intuitively , and how do our channels of perception work , and how does the cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs used to say you need to be ilway to understand how it works .
so you really have to look at the detail , if i want to make something user-friendly or intuitive , which is in the core .
and here you can see that you know a our seven senses , most of us think we &apos;ve only got five , and now it &apos;s even seven , and it &apos;s certainly going to come to the next future of the next , kind of sense , and as an extension of ourselves .
and looking at how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot of people use the word , but not at all , what it means then is detail .
but i have to understand , in the essence , when will information become information , when will be information , and from information , so that i know how to do things intuitively , or , of course , acceptable .
and of course , how does design influence the perception .
we see this here , when i design things , then i can get them confusing like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what salt and pepper , or i can kind of make them intuitively by showing things .
so much more natural , even in a vessel , but i kind of see where is salt and pepper in it .
and when i tell somebody , you give me salt or pepper , you get to think about where it &apos;s going to be for the first time , where &apos;s in it .
and the left-hand just intuitively , and then i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in it , that salt is just giving it accordingly .
but also our perception of self , how do they deceive us ?
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks larger than the small , although that &apos;s not too much the case , but they &apos;re just equal to the same size , and yet our perceptions , depending on which context we put things in .
does anybody know what that is ?
come on .
pattern recognition should work yet .
there &apos;s going to be a little bit more like my glasses .
so it &apos;s circle .
a second circle is already beginning to correlate to certain similarity or associate .
and then , when i stop a halboval , suddenly , suddenly we don &apos;t just see one unit again , which is a circle , and circle , and yet , we see one unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a different one .
it &apos;s called shape-law , or form psychology , which also affects us in perceptions as well .
what &apos;s important for the designers , they usually have this in the first semester , the great gesture laws .
round-legislation of the nearby , shaped law of the continuity and so on .
often in the third time , forget again .
but this is an essential component , if you want to make things intuitive as well as possible .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is that of vision .
it sounds really trivial , but it &apos;s really exciting when you get busy doing it .
so we have the front of the eyes , and now you think we &apos;re looking back from the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re first going to see it from backwards .
and that is , they dedicate a premise to the front that they see something that they recognize , unprecedented , unprecedented circle .
that is , we dedicate our first to see , before we see it , put it back in the back of our sehearer to say , okay .
i have the cognitive feedback that you &apos;ve projected , which is projected , which you want to see .
so that &apos;s there , then that comes back .
and then it goes forward , because the back doesn &apos;t steer the front , and says , actually , now it &apos;s going to look forward , and make sure that what you see is what you want to see , and that &apos;s what you want to see .
and then it goes back , and then it &apos;s actually only seen .
so a whole , quite exciting process of how certain things go down and what &apos;s happening for millisecond areas of these things .
i don &apos;t know who many of you know this picture .
and that &apos;s exactly what i just described to you .
now everyone from this pattern is trying to see something .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes that .
does anybody see something that is destined ?
a dalmatiner , right .
if i saw that , that &apos;s a dalmatiner in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore , because i &apos;ll show you where the dalmatiner is .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and further , now you see it all the time .
that is , i &apos;ve actually spoiled them right now , that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern in it anymore , but i &apos;ve contacted them within a very short period of time , to see this dog in this prescribed picture again . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and this is this projection of vision , feedback loops , seeing .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m projecting forward , i &apos;m looking at the dalmatiner .
i see the dalmatiner .
so all right , really exciting processes , which then in this , yes , gray is not actually , but it &apos;s not really going on right here in these rosanes mass right now .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i sort of get out of the present into the past loop , i can also overcome very well waiting times in which i &apos;m going to work with somebody with three seconds .
he &apos;s got to process that as a present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant waiting times , for example , on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what does the fifty milliseconds take ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a quite exciting phenomenon .
this is the time period you fall in love with .
that means , pay attention , if you know this now , look at who you &apos;re watching for a long time , because i don &apos;t take any gun for what can happen right now .
and six milliseconds , also a quite exciting phenomenon .
this is the timeline of most perceptions we have .
that means that the first impression is happening in a rapid speed of how we perceive things .
and as we also see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re sort of bending ourselves against the environment , so that we can think about it accordingly .
of course , the designers are not only concerned with the issue of perceptions and neural processing or cognitive surveys , but primarily , of course , with the subject of human objection .
so how does a person relate to some things .
there &apos;s the practical functions , as a matter of prospect , so formalaesthetic aspects , or formalaesthetic aspects .
there are signing functions , where i know exactly where i have to reach .
but there are also symbolic functions , why does somebody give for such a little , where almost anything is inside , such a horrent sum of money , even though it &apos;s not that practical ?
there we are , more like , in the symbolic level , at the level of meaning that we think of as a form , of course .
back to my actual topic of natural user interface and the topic , which is , of course , usability .
usability always means how can i get to a certain target fast , or how can a user be able to do in a certain context that can be effective , efficient and satisfying a goal .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
how can i do something that &apos;s user-friendly ?
can i use that directly or i need &apos; n handbook , or i need to have to have an excitement for that .
and it &apos;s less usable or user-friendly .
that i do it in a different shape and beautiful way doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better acceptable .
you also have to understand that .
and then , in part , if you look at the software that we just saw , you &apos;ll also understand why ninety-nine percent of our technology today &apos;s software is very intuitive , or not for deliberable , the i-pad in many areas or i-phone is plenty , although the software is plenty of doing so much more intuitive as a classic as a little bit of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of thing that &apos;s classical thing in classical stuff that the same kind of the same kind of thing in classical stuff that &apos;s business as a classical stuff that you can &apos;t in classical stuff you can in classical stuff that you can &apos;t do in classic in a little bit of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of doing anything that is in classical stuff in classical way that you can &apos;t in classic in a little bit of doing so far , in classical way that you can &apos;t in classical way that is a little bit of doing .
it &apos;s intuitive usability not only since apple wanted to use a basic economy , elementary success factor , if i wanted to use technology devices to people .
why ?
because we usually use this new kind of usability , which is the natural user of íterhow , for example , five times faster on average , on our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do some of the classic sofware , you need five hours and you have this new kind of natural software just an hour to do .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to be able to go home for four hours , but you &apos;re looking at your employer , or somebody &apos;s own way to deal with them for the four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , for us , it &apos;s a reassuring assessment , to acquire certain things as well .
so when we go back to the field of software , here &apos;s the first command line interfaces , which was very abstract where it took months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that &apos;s been working now with nem neural model or mental model like the software eergonoma , which is that you &apos;ve got an idea of something that &apos;s a metaphor of a desktop to use the computer .
so no longer zeros and ones or kryptic codes , but a metaphor .
so this actually made this much more user-friendly , but it &apos;s also much better , of course .
the next generation of the graphic user interface is already working a lot more with behavior .
so i , as a form , are much more common to behave than that .
this is also a paradigm shift .
that all of a sudden , that appearance is increasingly unimportant to success , and the usability is going to be an application .
and if i take it one step further into this natural user interfaces , where i have a voice , by language , by touch , by definition , by no longer mouse and cursor to control things , i &apos;m even faster , and i &apos;m also less mediate .
but that leads me to the point again , when are things going to be more intuitive ?
if you get more intuitive , and then i have to punish my little friend here and see what does that mean just from cognitive biomy , when is it really intuitive ?
and this is always intuitive for us as humans , if i have very little time to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t seem to think , he doesn &apos;t like to think it , but make it easy to do it reasonably .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does this mean for designers ?
that is , if we look at the fact that we can transmit existing gesture models from one to another , for example , the metaphor , then i can do the tongue as a shape .
that is , i can just sort of transmit an intuitive human action model to a piece of software and make the software a much more user-friendly way .
now , the question , of course , is , what &apos;s the most intuitive trade scheme of us humans , and now i &apos;ve already betrayed it .
this is called the osit-model .
this uses each of us , and osit is an acronym , and it &apos;s for orientation , select , inform , transactions .
that &apos;s what each of you does all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or , in part , instinctive .
the model is already exploded in the womb , and it &apos;s interculturally , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time , without the most of us knowing that this model is present .
osit osit itself will be about 50 to 70 thousand times more than activity , so in the sleep , it &apos;s found that it &apos;s often less punished than a day .
i can now orient this mental model , select , informed , transferring to an interactive system .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the desktops , but now not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a trajectory pattern , a trajectory principle .
and this is on a higher degree of utility than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the desktops .
and if i take this over now , for example , in which i refer to as oversight , select as a choice , inform in the trap , it &apos;ll come big on me , i can look at it in detail , and i can translate it , or i can cast it somewhere , and i can buy it , or i can buy it in the details , and i can buy it . &quot; i can buy it in detail , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; and i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; or &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; or &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can buy it , &quot; i can &apos;t . &quot; i can &apos;t . &quot; i can &apos;t . &quot; i can &apos;t . &quot; i can &apos;t .
and then i can transmit this .
i &apos;m going to try this through an example .
now , everyone &apos;s ever eaten a cake .
in fact , now i &apos;m interacting with the object , i can kind of zoom back out again , and i can zoom in .
i &apos;ll get the whole overview , and i can now filter and say , just show me all of the things with chocolate , for example .
and once you have an interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can access things like the piece , touch , and they come up to me is much more natural than if over hierarchically organized websites or other mechanisms can sort of make these kinds of things available .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to end as well as to give a and again , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to help you to a very particular aspect of curiosity .
the first thing that , when you get big as a child , as a baby , is you take care of what the divorces you have , yes ? and according to whether your parents allowed them to play more or less in the sound , and the more you see , their curiosity will be , of course .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so those of you who are here and are curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about using this whole environmental discussion , world decline , 40-year club-of-rome , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point there .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
they give off a number of magnitude every day , about two gram of phosphorus , and every day they have to absorb two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bones .
we could only glide as amorphous mollusks around the world .
in fact , if we don &apos;t take phosphorus and drop it off .
what &apos;s amazingly , is that we &apos;re looking at something here , which is actually self-intelligibility , but it &apos;s not that way .
because everyone &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only had two years of phosphorus phosphorus , and already now , it &apos;s taken a lot more uranium around the world than it &apos;s used in all the nuclear facilities .
in the last 20 years alone , five thousand tons of uranium have been distributed to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
it makes leukemia in kids .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , shake the environment , drive less car .
smash the environment , make less waste .
protecting the environment , consumes less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
it &apos;s like , if i said , shake your child , it &apos;ll beat only three times instead of five times .
that &apos;s just a little bit less destruction .
if we think about how to make a pipe like this , then our entire earth will be sooner or a cemetery later .
that &apos;s why thinking about the weighs .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground , first of all .
in the ground , over 60-percent of carbon is stored .
at the moment , we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 and 30 kilograms of 3tons per hectare , or attributing to the square meter .
that means we &apos;re losing in the soil about five thousand times more than re-educated .
we can , of course , look at the waste problem .
and everything is package or content .
for example , in open bach , on the trash , 20 percent of the garbage between wind .
and because we get older , the wind gets bigger .
that &apos;s them all in the headlines , in a way .
yes ?
a baby needs about six thousand wind .
we could , of course , reduce that by 10 percent , but what does it do ?
that &apos;s balanced in china for a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind ?
here &apos;s one of the proof that , by the way , men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is given in the pig over the fixed constituents of excrement .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening with it , right ?
traditionally , we think in the environmental debate , we &apos;re too many around the world .
and if you present to the people that , if you tell them , that would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , then you &apos;ll get refined and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilizing the human population .
in israel , you say , if you save a human life , you save the earth .
here &apos;s what it says , the more you kill , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on the planet , the ants weigh about four times more than us humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one likes termites in that far , even though they &apos;re vegetarians .
that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
and because they &apos;re working a lot harder than us , and because they only live three to six months in their weight , they lose something 30 billion people in energy use .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far away we are , what we really wanted to do and could , and how sad we are , that we are at all on earth , can you see that , for example , open bach has a program , up to 20 twenty people here , you want to be climaneutral ?
you can only be climaneutral if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only opportunity .
have you ever seen a clihuman eutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means we want to be dumber than trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
luckily not , yes ?
there is no overpopulation problem in trees .
there are still six billion trees in the amazon area alone .
you &apos;ve heard some of the overpopulation problems of trees before ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be dumber than trees .
and where you see , even a bit like demeter , the most strict bio-agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own metabolic products to go back .
we lose so three million tons of phosphorus every year that really had to go back in circles .
and we &apos;re too many with that .
that &apos;s it alone .
that means we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no bio-land , there &apos;s no bioland , no natural progression , and how they &apos;re all going to allow our own excrements to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
and we &apos;re too many of them .
it &apos;s made sense to be less harmful , in terms of oil consumption .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , the top one is not there , yes ?
nullemissions , yes ?
you can only have nuclear missions if you &apos;re not there .
even if you were shooting now , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
we can do it differently .
we can regain our nutrients .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil , where we &apos;re reclaiming nutrients .
directly , in this way , we can get nutrients back in agriculture .
we do this in china , for example , where we take the accidents from it .
in china , a tutoring of honeyfish is still honeydaughted , so to speak , yes ?
and in our western world , we &apos;ve always been too stupid , to bring our nutrients back .
that is , the whole western civilizational story draws that the city has always taken , but never given back to the farmers .
and so the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers were going to the cities and the cities had to keep getting their nutrients .
and so all of the western rich have always expanded until they haven &apos;t made the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re imploded .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve been breeding civilization over five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to get the nutrients back .
even today , if they &apos;re invited to dinner in china , they &apos;re expecting for their food to stay as long as they &apos;re searching up the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and take the nutrients .
you have them invited them to eat , not to the nutrient theft .
that is , you can see on the internet , how you can regain nutrients .
the really nice thing about this is , if you do that , agriculture is creating biogas , on a hectare country with five inhabitants in favelas , a farmer can generate about a hundred and a half dollars of tap and the plant waiting with it , chickens and the vegetables and the vegetables and the pig and the vegetables and the vegetables and the vegetables and the vegetables and the vegetables and the vegetables and the vegetables and the vegetables and the vegetables and the vegetables and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the pig and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables , and the vegetables .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate goes back in favelas over nine percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people , and we don &apos;t have to be bad at making them .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the facilities are carrying themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can just fix them .
that is , you know , go back the crime rates .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over a hundred and a half in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been sabolized .
you could just throw a liter altöl in there , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
there is no place .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , we don &apos;t have to be very bad at all .
we can support them to be good .
that means we have to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do something of it , you write yourself best in germany , in all the seats , in france , it &apos;s in france .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in open , but maybe you can just help the fringers a little bit .
because the france plant could best regain the phosphorus .
and it has to go back .
and what we &apos;re seeing is that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it goes through .
we &apos;ve been doing it for over three years in holland now .
the dutch government explained that they will be the first country in the world , which regains phosphorus .
but we need that overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of phosphorus conditions in the world .
there &apos;s the opec a bunch of orphanages .
that &apos;s 20 countries that control 40 percent of oil supplies .
and the oil is something that we can replace with other energy tiles .
but the phosphorus is not going to be replaced .
this is not about making the existing a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and it &apos;s first to ask , first of all , what is the right thing .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , you understand that easier , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine , for example , your wife is sad if you &apos;ve annoyed when you &apos;ve annoyed them , and they come in 50-odd roses .
totally inefficient .
but it &apos;s effective , yes ?
or take a lip pen .
a woman in germany eats about six comma three kilograms during her lifetime .
there it is .
this is not accurate scientifically , because we don &apos;t know how much gets kissed .
but a lip pen , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but very effective , yes ?
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
asking , what &apos;s the right thing to do ?
not to burn the enlightenment tube a little bit better and overload it and lose it in the combustion facility , and lose all the materials for cycles , but first of all , how do you enhance the cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i invite you to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with open taste and a glass of water .
wonderful , &apos; ne ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , reducing .
the whole environmental debate .
we tell people , oh , you don &apos;t have an environmental awareness in the south .
no , the throwing is exactly the right thing , right ?
at any point where you throw away , of , yes , you get lifespan again .
but the wrong things .
if you thrown the wrong things , you have a waste problem .
as we think from north .
there &apos;s every footprint that &apos;s disadvantaged .
if you walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
because the soil is going to die down the moose , and the wind and the water is washing away the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that &apos;s going to become a wetland .
not school management .
we say in germany , sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife like that ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , thank you so much , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so don &apos;t save , cite , avoiding .
every waste is nutrients .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , as people in the high bow do , throw out coke can from the car .
because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
it &apos;s &apos; shape of reviews , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the real design , please .
for example , we &apos;ve created an ice packaging , which is at room temperature of fluid .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
in two hours , it &apos;s built everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that they carry through throwing to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful about that .
so there are two cycles .
not all to be composable , of course .
you know , a tv machine or a washing machine , and they only use it , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things that have disappeared , like shoe soles , like braking belts , like authoritors , who have to be in the same way that they go into biological systems .
the things that are just used are going to go into systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
now very direct advertisements , not for the company puma per se , but for the fact that they &apos;re now helping this company to do these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do things freely anymore .
yes ?
so , if i invite you to eat and say , this is free of chicken , it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we &apos;re going to determine what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not poisonous inside .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes you can put in the cavalier launch on the pedestrian pedestrians , and the rubber can go into biological circles , right ?
all of this is composable of it .
and if we can do it , of course , we can do it for obesity , for nike , for henry and mauritz and all the textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the sewage problems around the world that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why you help with , ask people for a second .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve already transformed the chairman chairman for twice .
and i &apos;m not so sure that they really are going to stay down .
so , just help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s going .
yeah .
what &apos;s just been shown .
that &apos;s going .
now , we can do things like this , if you have fuzzy , if you break it , you can break it in biological circles .
the technical cycle is the same .
there &apos;s a direct feedback system for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , who &apos;s made to go back to the circulation .
so again , in every store , you can get things back .
if you get up , yes ?
do you remember the needle again ?
if it &apos;s the waste right now .
these winds are all over the place , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there it is on the deponies , but otherwise in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water storage , inside that you can onto cell losebase , then you can plant with a baby in israel or in tunisia .
yes ?
just if you take these divisions , you shrink , you sterilize them , and you put the powder in order to plant trees .
so this is the baby &apos;s carbon positive for all of life , from the very beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be climaneutral , we can be climate positive .
it &apos;s kind of a scattered poop print .
yeah , so to speak .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything else .
i started an institute on this .
there &apos;s a lot of people working with them now , and they can all get engaged .
there &apos;s an extra clue to cradle to cradle , where anybody can join .
so no longer save , avoiding , reducing , not school management , but smart waste .
do you mind ?
thank you .
the work of the interpreter .
music as a language .
and the description to my talk is written that i , as an interpreter , i understand myself as a translator , which is the english word .
interprets are translators of writing grades in clinical music .
that , as translator , you don &apos;t just have to understand the word for the text into another language , but you need to understand the deeper sense of words and work-aviation so that there &apos;s a meaningful translation , everyone who has to do with strangers .
to translate from german into english , more knowledge can be asked , or even when you &apos;re talking about poetry or poetry or even about poesy . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
strangers , but it &apos;s for layas , what we do to musicians with our music language .
as an interpreter of a piece of music , i first have the written notes .
you think that the composer is written into the grades exactly everything he drew out of there .
in fact , the grades are very vague and imprecisely .
these notes are roughly the same or inaccurate , like a verbal , if very seemingly accurate accurate , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal nature description , the smell of flowers is not to smell , the degree of the green is to only hear the saddles of the wind , not feel .
that is , the interpret has to translate this inexact act amount of emergency language into another , which is audible , concrete , nonverbal music language .
today , i want to tell you what else i do with musical translation , which is to interpret , again , into a verbal language .
so basically translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do the whole rather in german , because if i had to translate it into english again , it would be significant to me in translation of translation of translation of translation .
so those of you that music works for me as much as spoken language .
the noted notes have the function of the letters of a writing .
so it &apos;s not enough to learn just to read notes and to press the notes that are appealing on the piano or the right position on a violin string .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
you can see the meaning of the letters first if you can tell the language about it .
and so , for the learning process of music , you have to have at least as long as the spoken language .
now , there are increases in it , whether you &apos;re learning it for spending , you can only understand , or you can actively speak to the musical mother &apos;s language .
the work of the interpreter starts kind of like a theater director .
after you &apos;re looking for a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re first exploring the trajectory of composition .
you collect information about the piece in the secondary literature .
you read in the letters , dials , notes , or whether there are words , thoughts of composers themselves .
you study the works that he had composed before and after .
you do comparisons .
the reasons to write it .
how and how did he feel ?
what was its circumstances of life , like the society and the politics ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
you think in that time by looking at contemporary pictures , for example , or reading literature .
but over time , as a interpret , you have a rich knowledge to think and feel the composers you play more often , and it always makes you easier to think and feel in them .
the composer is getting more and more to the friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece becomes more and more and more about my personal cause to play it .
now that the notes are all other than an accurate record of the composer &apos;s composer , but only a framework , i now turn this framework to replenish it with meaning and meaning .
i &apos;m going to say , in my own words , what might be written between this framework .
i play games explaining what these sounds might have .
now for me and for the composers back then , and what they might mean for him today .
every tone , every phrase gets a sense of it , because i feel it myself , because it comes from my personal scholar .
it has to be coherent to me here and now , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can get the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve worked out for as long as i can experience new .
how to re-experienced a happy new day , although over and over with the same ritual of life , stand up , breakfast , go to work , so do i keep doing the same piece over and over again .
i grew up again a day , changing seasons , my pulse goes slower at night than the morning , in a concert hall , it takes longer to come back home than the sound is coming back at home .
i &apos;m going to take the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
all of this affects me and all of this also affects my experience with composition .
well , it &apos;s wonderful also , if i &apos;m standing on the stage with a duo partner , and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing happens in a good , fair conversation .
you bring a new idea into it , and as soon as that answer gets answered with a response .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen that we haven &apos;t tried , and what you can &apos;t sample from that kind of thing .
it &apos;s a lot of fun doing music this way , and you as the audience have experienced how the music communicates alive .
so each concert is a different concert .
i will never play more like this moment .
i can &apos;t play the way i do it today in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more life experience than i am today , and therefore on my palette of music grains have much more color opportunities , in emotion and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;ll then blend some color buttons out too , but i &apos;ll get new ones to do it .
have a nice specific example of this .
it was on a piano courtship for music students in my beloved teacher , professor jürgen ude , a famous beetho-specialist , concert pianist , and long-standing professor of music school here in stuttgart .
unfortunately , i was too young , so that he was already emitted when i finally started studying .
but i was very fortunate to meet him at the age of three , 10 years old , and so i &apos;ve been on his classes at the time of my school .
i was seven kilos when i went back to one of his classes , and i played the last of the four ballads of chopin , a pinpoint .
he asked me what the instructions of this ballade was for me .
this is a gesture part .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
and then he rooted , and he said , &quot; right ?
that &apos;s got to be the difference of aging .
because to me , it means memory .
he was over six .
well , on seventh 10 , you still have dreams , but you don &apos;t have major memories .
i &apos;m playing the piece over every few years now , and it &apos;s changed for me , although it hasn &apos;t changed the only note .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because over and over again , i &apos;ll read something new .
one example of this from a very different area . monet painted the seerotic x times .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s different daytime , in different light .
he transferred the sea eroses , as he saw them , as they acquired on him at that moment .
his personal impressions of the seaerotic .
the x-ray interpretation of a piece is comparable to this .
by now , i &apos;m older than chopin &apos;s than two-thirds years old , when he wrote the piece .
it &apos;s only neundy-30 years that he &apos;s lived .
and it &apos;s important to keep looking into the notes , even though i mean to be able to memorize them .
to keep out twin practices , directly with composers .
because the grades are the only connection directly to him .
especially if it &apos;s already died .
now , how do you begin to talk about the language of music ?
i said , you know , you have to do it for about the same kind of spoken language .
so often the music class is that you first learn to read the notes .
you basically learn reading first before you just speak one word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
and then when all the fingers get on time and just like they move in the notes , they come out , they sound like music .
and when that &apos;s not going to happen , the student gets the next little bit of a trickier .
it &apos;s not talked about interpretation in the initial class .
well , there it is , in the front of the presto , which is a quick piece .
lento , slowly .
loud and white , f and b , et cetera .
most of you know this stuff .
but even if you replace those angles , there &apos;s still a little bit of technical .
and still , it &apos;s not an interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very elementary .
and that is that to make music on the instrument that should do their own musical things and feel there before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a kid who didn &apos;t learn to sing because the parents didn &apos;t pretend to do it , won &apos;t do it by themselves .
this is like learning a talk .
it &apos;s needed to have its own experience and the idea of music , and then to have it about another way , which is to bring about an instrument , to sound .
people who have never saved , along the way , have never felt directly with their own body , what it &apos;s like to form a tone .
to design a phrase with its own breath .
because the musical instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
the melody emerges from the genes and the rhythm from the dance .
the longevity report with music today is not progressive .
you don &apos;t need to make music even if it &apos;s going to be boring .
there &apos;s no need to whistle or sing a song .
every single music is being made by being dumped from the outside with music all the time .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing myself ?
the question i ask you , can &apos;t you sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start with trying to figure out if they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to use these little muscles that use the vocal chords , really use them .
because you can train that .
or c , because you &apos;ve complained to them that they &apos;re inevitable .
and i ask , how skillfully competent was this diagnosis ?
have you done a second or third opinion , as you say beautiful today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and therefore you want to have nix to do it .
but what i &apos;d like to do now is , because music is a beautiful , communicative thing .
but you might still be able to disagree with them .
well , you see , in all cases , no one has to be an outlook candidate .
but don &apos;t tell you , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m going to answer that , but i &apos;m sure you can tell if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think somebody says it , i don &apos;t know if i taste it , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t give up food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to go through classical music as well , because they don &apos;t have to play an instrument .
listen consciously and tell them if they taste it or not .
whether or not the music is too sweet or too sweet .
tell what you feel .
over time , you also get contradictions , and you want to have a little bit more spicy or even taste a little bit of a difference .
now , why am i asking for my audiences that it &apos;s also actively listening ?
because music is a language , and a language is to communicate .
a piece of artwork you never look at has no force to act .
the food that &apos;s been boiled by a chef or a chef , needs to be eaten and not just looked at or swapped out recipes .
so please listen if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice soundscape .
if in an environment where adults do active music or at least hear active music music , a child grows up , it &apos;s easy for a music teacher to ask what color does your flower have ?
can you play them in blue now ?
and the kid plays , after a memorial , instead of having a red flower , a blue flower before .
and this sounds very different from before .
and that was the very first beginning of your own musical expression .
so the first step in interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred , or two hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have evolved .
there was , at the time , bachs as an instrument , not a piano .
it was just not invented yet .
i think the bach would have been thrilled if he had the sound capabilities of the modern modern world .
i can today turn on the sounds that the stream has , on the modern wing , to sound what a baroque cembalo can &apos;t .
and by beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had become deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that an orchestra was then regarded as unplayful .
so the composers rely on us interprets , reinventing the pieces again .
so they &apos;re going to hear what they &apos;ve only imagined in the ghost .
and also , what you would think in the mind today .
or the thing that i imagine today is that what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what is neid ?
have you ever been neidish ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
and when i come , with my little v v piesel and i &apos;m wrong , that feeling gets up .
i am shooting through my head .
i say , ulf , what do you need to have a big car ?
that &apos;s already in the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work a lot less than i do .
why do i have to afford little car like that ?
and then immediately , i find myself , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , that unpleasant feeling is gone .
our organism has invented a great way of creating these uncomfortable feelings like neid to make it disappear .
you can also try this in words like revenge or winning or gathering or something .
i want to explain to you today about this mechanism or something that &apos;s unconsciously familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lie you may have heard about when people say no one has to build a wall .
and then dock up stones so he loans them the point of view .
on a lie like this , you see that the liar itself doesn &apos;t believe what it says .
it &apos;s easy to verify that it &apos;s very different in mind .
he &apos;s just fooling you and not himself .
no , the lying i &apos;m talking about has to do with fooling themselves .
you need that lie to sustain a life lie to sustain self-deception .
they can make them less easy , yes , checking or also to collapse .
they need time .
and this is an anecdote that you may know about .
spanish painter pablo picasso once has portraired a woman .
this woman then complained , after all , the portrait wouldn &apos;t look similar to her .
picasso : just wait .
you &apos;re getting more and more similar .
at this point , and when you laugh , you see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a broken relationship to lying .
the artist shares you with something , and most of all this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see when she just looks in the mirror .
the artist shares you in such a portrait with you , something you &apos;ll only be familiar with when you look at this artwork over and over again .
and then this awkward feeling disappears , and it could not look like you , and it will always make you more similar .
here you have this mechanism that we can use on the lie as a great invention to stabilize our lifestyles .
and not only in art , but in the culture , in which mythology , in stories it appears again .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him , who &apos;s the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility coming out of this true origin , even the mirrors can &apos;t lie out of that true origin .
but we should just get familiar with not being able to tell a woman that there &apos;s a much more beautiful somewhere else .
it &apos;s needed to get what we understand under politically correctness over and over again .
we need these lies at this point that keep us deception , without which we can &apos;t live at all .
we have not only in the art in the culture division , but also in science , we have these great lies .
and there &apos;s this story about the woman of the bischofs of worchester .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of man .
that the man should come from the monkeys and , yes , there would be a common ancestry between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her husband and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true what charles is writing . &quot;
the human is supposed to come from the monkeys or have a common ancestry .
no , no , that can &apos;t .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to stop remembering people to know about it .
why do we have to stop getting people to know about something when it &apos;s true ?
because without that life , we can &apos;t live .
because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , descent of the highest creatures , not from such a direct level , of something that uncomputational like a organism that still exists to a stone comparable , and whatever things that are , to us , is irreversible .
so , we can &apos;t help these things at all .
we have to prevent people from getting to knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism is going to trigger and what the traces that it leaves in something different than it is in this great picture of ourselves , i want to close to you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
my wife told me her .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told a student .
an autistic student .
she likes to love him especially because he has a propensity for sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the firemen .
and because i &apos;m in the firemen , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnical things .
yes , you already feel it when you &apos;re healthier at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a human in a moral justification , used the word because , we should try to replace it by the word , even though .
do that one time , and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnical things .
you feel that this is the real truth behind the origin .
so a little bub , who &apos;s not interested in firelions .
they &apos;re interested in firemen .
but there are no clubs that we can look around , where you &apos;re learning how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , just the firemen .
there he signed up .
and you don &apos;t even say to his teacher , you don &apos;t like to put a brine somewhere , and you enjoy having your fire come up afterwards .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of removing the dangers , the other people only get to do when they just lay fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this evidence that , in the heart of the bub , he was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that out loud .
here you have this censor between the unconscious and the conscious one that immediately jumps away without doing something about it , and the things that you know is very different , designed to sound a lot better for you and others .
so just like this , you know , words that we &apos;re also reusing in the language of the political speech over and over again .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know , when we talk about that , social relations are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t do that easy .
it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in a society that is supposed to work .
now i want to show you what we found in my institute .
what kind of logique is this deception , this self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the ones that we actually know in the unconscious way that it &apos;s valid to spread outside .
so here , i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is what many of you know , and some of you have estimated , quite a few of them don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is such a mental thing , says something about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that is not foundless , material nature .
and if you have people who are really convinced that they have a soul , or you can also say , that they have been thrown away from the soul to life , think of it as sort of a soul that would be a spiritual framework , and it &apos;s not like it was made of solid stuff that kind of solid matter itself , or something like it &apos;s estead-like it &apos;s made of solid stuff that it could be something like it &apos;s made of solid stuff that it &apos;s made of solid matter matter itself , and unfolifoutragedy stuff that it &apos;s made of solid stuff that it was something like it &apos;s made of plain the plain the plain the plain the plain their own , or what it &apos;s made of solid matter itself , or something like it &apos;s made of matter itself , and it &apos;s made of install-like it &apos;s made of matter itself , or what it &apos;s made of matter , or what it &apos;s made of matter , or what it &apos;s made of install-made of install-like it &apos;s made of matter matter matter matter , or something like it &apos;s made of matter , or what it &apos;s just stead-like it &apos;s made of install-made of matter .
and of that soul , you now think that you &apos;re kind of in this cloudy nature , in this funny nature , the anima is called it in the latin , the lufthalso , is present .
and if this lufthalso arises over human beings , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature that can only live , just with the soul .
and then he can walk away .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to get from the outside to human .
so we &apos;re supposed to perceive them as something that is necessarily for our lives .
and if you have that requirement , then you understand the logic that we experience this happiness by a lie to improve our world .
because now you can apply a three sentence .
three sentence you &apos;re still familiar with at school .
this is now a three sentence that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
here you need some logic , but also to lie the willingness .
because lying like this , you can just apply this logic wrong .
in this three sentence , three sentences emerge .
the first sentence is , claim , there are no soul .
so the second sentence is , if claw is right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i particularly emphasized him here .
a third sentence , which appears immediately in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have soul , who &apos;s dead , and can &apos;t say anything at all .
and here you already feel it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this deceptive talk , that &apos;s the expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , which are logically accurate .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about reality .
i can say the manager is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the manager is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the manager is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when claus says , there are no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are logical .
and now we feel our mischief of consciousness immediately , and then you can do something .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it does like the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and presented .
because in fact , we have to prove whether there &apos;s no soul or not .
but with this logic that it just uses two sentences are locally accurate , and that &apos;s a third one that looks like he had something to do with it , so that we can save our lives .
so , we pretend it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can continue these things in different examples .
in the present , for example , we have a very modern example , which has filled the newspapers over and over again .
to this , you have to have another philosophical topic , a permanent burning of philosophy .
this has to do with the fact that we go back to the fourth century .
there was a scholar named johannes buridanus , and after that , the buridanus is named named johannes buridanus .
the buridansche esel is an esel made out of pure nature .
he doesn &apos;t have that soul .
this is a natural thing .
and if you place the exact in the middle between two major hairs , he then stares .
because he doesn &apos;t know what piles he &apos;s supposed to go to first .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
so the natural things are imagined .
equal powers with opposing against each other &apos;s exclamation signs .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you take another example , so if you make the haystack larger , it doesn &apos;t have to have a reason , and it doesn &apos;t need anything to do it .
it automatically runs to the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , you &apos;re going to be determined by the larger pile , which is instantly pulling you , then you also have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re at the main place here in frankt , i remember the max planck-institute of brain science .
there &apos;s a scholar that &apos;s called wolf singer , and he sometimes says wolf singer &apos;s &quot; will &quot; be free . &quot;
now we can make the second set , and we can say , if wolf singer is right , then he doesn &apos;t have any freedom of freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read almost every day in the daily newspaper , that &apos;s what you find in this third sentence .
it looks , for example , who doesn &apos;t have any freedom of freedom , can &apos;t be drawn to your actions and claims for responsibility , and it &apos;s therefore inadequate .
again , they have it again .
in fact , the first time you have to prove whether there &apos;s something that &apos;s free to be free .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first set of ideas were wrong , of course you had to take the opposite without proof proof .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test something yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice that courage to lie .
so , practice this , for example , if you look at a human being , and then you can say , there &apos;s no more predictive .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for predictor , which is called prophet .
you can &apos;t call that , that would have been incorrect again a little bit of political .
you know , there &apos;s no predictable ones .
immediately , they will have one that , of course , there are such predictors , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you already have a problem .
because while you &apos;re busy trying to make it clear that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no more predictable , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s all happy about it because he deceived it .
because he &apos;s led them to a fiddle where he &apos;s not holding himself up .
because actually , this person is not interested in prove at all .
he &apos;s just interested in liberating himself at the need to prove that there &apos;s more predictable .
so , in the kind of shifting of evidence , they experience the brilliance of lying .
and once again , if you have one way to feel that three sentence in other people , you do it , because you &apos;re going to make other people happy if you don &apos;t remember your own lie in that way .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good afternoon .
i allowed me to ask lilly if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the tenders here from this great session , and asked me if i give a talk here and give my idea a prize .
i have to say , you know , you managed to get it , it was hard to talk about my idea at first .
and i might want to imagine my island project that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum all over many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one of the two nice girls still around , and i &apos;m probably one of the generation who &apos;s been searching for this bad auko image , because i &apos;ve already begun to study engineering construction in lsruh , technical school , i think it &apos;s called it .
and it then hit me in the middle of the eighteand years after berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energy , and i didn &apos;t have it in karlruh .
there was the fiscal research facility called leopoldshafen .
it was all kfa then called the jewish kfa .
it &apos;s called project carriers today .
because a good engineer either built great cars , or nuclear power plants .
but something like &quot; n solar pendulum , &quot; which kind of comes out of a hundred watts from the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy collaboration .
i &apos;m grateful to the premium-cola person that he rehabilited the word again , because after the mouths , you couldn &apos;t use the word again , because everything on the left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the aquitous years .
there was just so that there was self-managing alternative operations , and one of them was sitting in croszberg in the majority of places where you suspect evil .
it was a place of terrorism , but it was washed up tronics and made wind and solar energy , and i started in the middle of the eighteenth .
and yes , a lot of what i was told today is very touched me , because many , many beautiful expressions were the ones that i &apos;ve also lived through .
i worked 11 years at collective , which was grassroots .
we were 20 people .
when a no one said , the vetoprinzip was completely crushed . i &apos;ve had a hard attention for 10 years to know if i really had my great engineering window to go for a dazzling thing , because all my peers used to blame him for a little bit of your father &apos;s money as well as much as much as much as much as any other than you could have been dismissed the money as much as any other than you &apos;ve been doing that you &apos;ve been a little bit of your dad used for your father &apos;s time . you &apos;ve been doing a little bit of your dad &apos;s money . &quot; of your dad &apos;s money . &quot; -- you &apos;ve been doing it was a little kid . you &apos;ve all my father &apos;s money -- you &apos;ve all my dad &apos;s time . you &apos;ve all my father &apos;s money . you &apos;ve all my father &apos;s money . you &apos;ve been a little bit like that you &apos;ve all your dad used to blended up for your dad &apos;s worth wakeending your dad &apos;s time , you &apos;ve been a little while you &apos;ve all my dad &apos;s money . you &apos;ve been a little bit of your dad &apos;s time , you &apos;ve all my father &apos;s time . &quot; you &apos;ve been a little bit like that you &apos;ve all your dad &apos;s offered the money . &quot;
it &apos;s busy .
and this was really very , very bitter , and then you get into this period , and you just showed up a picture where i asked myself , after 10 years , a thousand thousand marks were back then , basic take-off in the collective , of course , that was the great thing to be .
and then i &apos;ve been out to six and a half thousand , and then along with friends i &apos;ve become co-founder company solon , which then became the spin-off cell cells from one of the greatest cell manufacturers in the world .
we have a huge collection story , but we have , of course , again , the problem of a growing company , and then we have two-thousand-six , a small group , decided we &apos;re going to start smaller and go back to people &apos;s next topic of the future , and that is not about what &apos;s going on .
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce you now .
and the title of the talk was , well , how do you get a hundred percent renewable ?
and we &apos;ve just begun to ask a relatively simplistic story of where could you be using a memory meaningfully today .
on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the azors .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
they have a five-10 percent renewable energy rate today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have any more ?
it just doesn &apos;t work technologically .
if you add more wind power to each other , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m always telling the politicians when they &apos;re in berlin adolescence our facility .
they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our grid is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we already have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , calculated this was two-thousand2006 , the first contacts with the island have just been figuring out .
how big would it have to be such a battery that you would have to have an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 17 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go another slide .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a year , about a hundred gigawatts of electric power are added on the same basis .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the energy hunger of the world that &apos;s going to take place is wiped out by diesel , because you don &apos;t need to be approved .
that &apos;s fast .
you place box like this .
and then it usually looks like this .
and over the course of this , three of these are always waiting , and two are always waiting .
yes , this is what one down there is just the load .
we also got very accurate data .
and the wind plant or the solar plant or whatever it is , usually a back-up system is a system that can only eat in small quantities here .
our goal was to just say , okay .
the diesel is going to be back-up and the wind , and the sun is serving the burden so that they can map the larger fraction .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn that off .
that is , at the moment , you have to make sure that renewables can sort of take over the entire net .
and of course , you can only be mancized in some way .
no one in the world has done that .
that &apos;s in a small scale , so you can also use your rasizer in the car over a little bit of a change judge .
people always ask me , what do you do because , actually , you know , in adlershard ?
that &apos;s going on .
but if you want to compensate multiple of these interactions , and you want to build a network , it &apos;s going to be very complicated .
and our goal was to get there , we wanted to get from 70 to nine percent renewable , and then the rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewables , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you make it out of batteries .
this is definitely going to be a source of energy , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , it &apos;s going to be .
you have to go on a seasonal memory and not only do you think of winter summer and tag night .
we just wanted to know , what about a normal electrochemical battery , what about normal electrochemical battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then they did a whole bunch of simulations .
and they simulated wind and sun and simulate the burden , and they came to the outcome , a really exciting conclusion that in the conventional system , in 20 years , you need a middle-class stroke of about 50 cents a kilowatt-hour , which is about 40-odd cents .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
well , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper , like the same system , if the same prize goes up five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating with the insulaners .
what should be done ?
i &apos;ve negotiated with investors , i &apos;ve looked for new social shepherds .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild one to rebuild society .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green one is our system .
that our system also has a price increase , because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent of this now , and we &apos;re not going to go through the other things that we &apos;re not going to go through .
and the power-utility , which has generated the electricity company on the island , has said , well , we love that .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can sort of map the electrical proportions of the island at a scale to three very precisely .
that is , we were looking for the first time to find the world &apos;s largest battery battery battery .
here it is .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , where the fall comes from japan .
and funny , it &apos;s been designed in the &apos; 70s at bbc mannheim , today abb , and then it &apos;s been licensed to the japanese .
it &apos;s you can see , it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it &apos;s got a megawatts power , and it can get that power for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of get out simulation techniques .
and then they set them up .
we also have one of these same aggregate at the same size , as it stands there , bringing it to the hall , actually the complete dynamic behavior of this net , so in the hall , it looks like this , where the big battery stands over here .
over here , we &apos;re simulate the whole transtrajectory system , the miles of physics of cables to sort of map the vibrational behavior on the net .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also turn two hundred kilowatts of photovoltaics onto the net .
so here we can see this again , again , this el again , the whole , individual aggregate .
and what we &apos;ve done since two millennium , the hall was then finished , until today , by two and a half of those , we &apos;ve done everything here between the single system of electronics , we &apos;ve done it .
so we &apos;re not a battery manufacturer , we &apos;re defining ourselves as a company that &apos;s just between the issue of battery and the web and everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to the battery , you also have to communicate to the grid , and it &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty of this is that , in fact , on this island , you can now take all this away from problems that we &apos;re going to get if we &apos;re going to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion of how is going to move and forth right now , energy turn , like that , on the island , we have , for example , in five to 30 percent extent , so we tire the wind and the sun .
natural light then offers smart grid .
so smart-grid , a big topic everywhere .
we can start to integrate , on the island before , with integrating electric mobility , questions , because you can flourish the burden .
that is , if you &apos;re in 70 percent renewable , you &apos;re not going to be able to do that without memory .
you can go through &apos; n smart-grid , you can , by building the nets , yes , you should certainly be able to hear the proportion , but you will never be able to defend on memories completely .
and that &apos;s the n bit of the message .
that &apos;s why a lot of people are coming and looking at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off this oil , you don &apos;t have this crude mass that &apos;s created a certain inertia on the grid .
and our european compound web is basically just made out of louder rotating masses of big power plants , where the wave is all the way around europe .
we look inside this net , we see the 50-odd hertz , and when it gets ninety-four comma nine hertz , we start to make some valves , again , a little bit of a steam steam , then we get up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly speaking .
if you tear it down somewhere , it &apos;ll take a while .
the spider reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the grid stable .
and over time , you can react to other people .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , this rotating mass , then you have to replace that with productivity electronics and electrochemistry .
and we can turn that big battery off two milliseconds into a milliseconds .
and then you can see which there are enormous speed possibilities .
and the message is , we have to get on these rotating masses , if we sort of hold our goals , 20 percent , 20 , 20 , 30 , 30 percent , 30 percent and so on , if we want to do it at all .
and then we have to rebuild our must-run capacity on the net .
must-run means just running the power plant to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , building the coal power plant , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or we don &apos;t have to bind , because it &apos;s not going to go .
and we &apos;re just trying to make it clear that you can degrade the capacity , the must-run of ccapacity , by getting electrochemical stores into the web .
and fortunately , there &apos;s a whole bunch of studies to do that now .
and then , for that purpose , people always come and look at our experimentation , which is sort of our incubator test .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far can you have a piece of future out there .
and many discussions i &apos;ve had over the last six years were similar to the discussion i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years on the photovoltaics .
you can &apos;t , it &apos;s intact , it &apos;s toy , we &apos;ve done everything ; never calculates .
we have now 30 gigawatts of photovoltaics in germany .
this is pre-imaginative .
and i just assume that in the next 30 years , we will have the same capacity of electrochemical storage all over the world .
it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s going to come .
there will be a whole bunch of circumstances and there will be arguments .
the beautiful thing is , i &apos;ve seen right now in the last two years , that the scientists are putting themselves on my side .
we &apos;ve now got about 10 million funding projects , so we &apos;ve got about ne 10 megawatt-battery now to climb the german web .
this will happen next april .
so you also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and only from this defense , to the idea , there &apos;s a hundred percent renewable agreement .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a tarking system .
so far in discussions , these insulanes , are always trying to do , and they have their own little net , and that &apos;s what we have to do with our own connected and nothing .
the question , though , is very simple , when you get completely independent from any fossil or primal energy carriers drilled around the world and they &apos;re brought to them , then they &apos;re an island .
then they only consume what &apos;s there on the sun and the wind there , where they live .
and that &apos;s a little bit our vision of a reasonable energy supply , and i &apos;m cradle-to-cradle , and i &apos;m also grateful that they &apos;ve said to use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and it turns out to be , as well as the talk of premium kola , that again you can be a collective and use solar energy , here &apos;s a little bit of a wrap together .
and all right , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet a little bit crazy and also have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s going to be done .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the los angeles times columnist went through the streets of los angeles one day , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathetic , rau , homeless , who played on a violin who had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because steves article was later a book that was filmed again with robert downey junior when steve lopez and jamie foxx was considered nathaniel anthony ayers , the contrabus , the jected jet of juillid-election .
nathaniel left juilliard , a breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless man on the streets of skid at the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all to read steves book or look at the movie so that not only do you understand the wonderful comfort that emerged between those two men , but how the music helped make that compound and how it ended up being the instrument that word game is made by the midair .
i met mr ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney conchall .
he had just heard a demonstration of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came backstage to imagine me .
he talked about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would never make it into the baseball world series , and all of that because of the obvious passage of the first beethoven &apos;s fourth fourth &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; unclear &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; .
we got to talk about music . and a few days later , i got an email that said nathaniel was interested in education for me .
i have to mention that nathaniel rejected a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electroshocks and thorazin and handcuffs , a trauma that followed him all his life .
and as a result of that , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he disappears in the streets of skid row , always exposed to this horror and the torture of his own mind .
and in such a rice stadium , nathaniel , when we started considering hall with our first class in walt disney , and he had this inflamer in his eyes completely lost .
he talked about invisible dawn , smoke and how he wanted to pour him in the sleep .
i was scared , not opinion , but i was scared i could lose it , that he could fall into one of his states , and that i could destroy him his relationship to the mind if i started talking about tongue and arggios and other exciting forms of diddy pedawn .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in the nathaniels eyes , there was a complete shift going on .
it was as if he stood under the influence of an invisible arznei , a chemical response , whose catalyst was my game .
nathaniels manic zorn transformed into understanding , into quiet curiosity and courage .
and like a miracle , he took his violin , and he started playing some sections of violin concert , and then asked me to finish it : mendelsson , tschaicowski , sibelius .
so we started talking about music from bach to beethoven , brahms , bruckers and all the other bs , from bartok to esa pekka salons .
and i realized that not only had an encyclopedic knowledge about music , but it connected it to it also a close personal relationship with it .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i know only about my colleagues in the philharmony of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , it was from this paranoid , confused man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a loving , educated , sketchy , skilled musician in juilliard assembled musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means seelian health .
because the music allows him to reform his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he escapes his torture set of circumstances .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
and that &apos;s why we make music : so that we have something that is inside of us all , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , we can form from our creativity to reality .
and the reality of this expression reaches all of us , inspired , inspired , and united with us .
what nathaniel went on , that &apos;s how the music brought him back into a community of friends .
the triggering power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him , who embraced his talent and carried him .
and i &apos;m going to make music with nathaniel , whether in the walt disney conchall or skid row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i have undesperately stolen the celliest .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate monkey .
it was a beautiful fish , tastier , good consistency , sustainable , a bestseller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was cultivated in aquakulture after the most offered standards of sustainability .
so you might feel like you could sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the boss of the company called and asked if i could wear on an event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our cooks . how do we keep fish on our menu ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fished the oceans of how we &apos;ve beaten forests of the tile .
it &apos;s hard to over-evaluate the destruction .
ninety percent of the big fish we love , the tunas , the soda , the salmon , smiling fish , they &apos;re broken together .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so i think it &apos;s going to be a part of our future , aquakulculture , of fishing , a part of our future .
a lot of the arguments about it . fish facilities pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a 15 to one feed processing from 15 to one .
that means that 15 pounds of wild fish are necessary to get a pound tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so , finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the ceo of public ity for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts right , you &apos;re famous for building as far out in the ocean that you don &apos;t contaminate the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish is not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this forage of 2.5 to 1 , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i set up .
and that night i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don on .
i said , &quot; don , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i phones with a few people in the company , and no one could give me a proper answer until finally i was with the conductor biologists .
we also call it don &apos;t .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish meals , and then he said , chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , lacking , skin , bone flour , rests , dried and processed into food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent your old age is chicken ? &quot;
in terms of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what is sustainable to feed chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long break in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i was devastated by this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-enjoyable and gutman .
i &apos;m actually that .
no , i actually fell in love with this fish , because , i swear to god , who &apos;s shot fish after this conversation after chicken .
that second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic species , the way in which you know the better you know your fish , you love the fish more .
i ate him first in a restaurant in southern spain .
a jurisdic journalist had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s sort of sued us up .
he came up to the table with a light , almost immune white color .
the chef cooked him .
hold twice .
and amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste so well after it was cooked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand them .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
this is a fish crawling in the southwestern corner of spain .
she &apos;s close to the flush guadalquivir .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentina .
they were growing beef beef beef , which was basically wetlands .
they did that by irrigating the country .
they built this complicated series of channels , and they urge water out of the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds in this place .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company that actually bought the land .
what did they do ?
they reverse the flow of the water .
they literally switched the lever .
instead of pushing the water out , they used the channels to put the water back in .
they were flooding the channels .
they created a 1,000 acres of fish -- bark , seawel , shrimp , aal -- and miguel and his company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
she stares out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is flooded channels and those density , lush march .
i was not there long time ago with miguel .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile to the kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we were fought by the wetlands and i keuche and sweats , i have matsch to my knees , and miguel lays in quiet for a biologist lecture .
here he picks up a rare glide .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of needles that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe .
it turns out miguel spent most of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how he got to become such a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
and then it goes and it bursts into more just rare birds and algae and odd water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unplugged , like this .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this cooked piece of delicious fish that i had on the night .
so i interrupted it . i said , &quot; miguel , how does your fish taste so well ? &quot;
he pointed to the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
what &apos;s the food processing ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system , that the fish would eat what they were eating in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , is what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-esteful .
there &apos;s no food .
is it the only one farm that your animals don &apos;t feed ?
later on , i went around on this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
the moment it was like a movie director had requested a stage shift .
and we bend around the corner , and we had the most incredible insight , thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker flamingos , literally , a pinker of carpet as far as the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at their stomachs , pink .
they &apos;re dragging . &quot;
worse ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you drag your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds .
well , last year , on this site was 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become the largest and one of the most important private population reserves in all of europe .
i said , &quot; miguel , is there a well-digested avian avian population not the last thing you want to have on a fish elevator ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensively , not intense .
this is an ecological network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker the belly the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s think about this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measures your success in your predators health .
a fish sphering , but also an avian reserve .
oh , and by the way , these flamingos should not even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away , where the surface of the soil is better for the nest maintenance .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night , they fly back 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the argued white line in the state street a92 .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , you fly 240 miles to the farm and then fly them back to the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i had just quoted a song by whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like it suck . i don &apos;t like it suck .
it &apos;s this kind of coated taste that they cook .
i almost never cooked with it .
and yet , when i tried them in this restaurant in southern spain , she didn &apos;t look like fish skin at all .
it tasted sweet and in , like if you were to take a bite off the ocean .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he nodded .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something comes into the body .
it &apos;s evolved over the course of evolution to seek out units . &quot;
and then he added in , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have any contaminants . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that measures their success in their predators &apos;s success .
and then i realized , if he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have any contaminants , because the water that &apos;s flowing through that farm comes from the river guadalquir .
it &apos;s a river which has all the things that have , from the rivers today , tend to lead them with themselves , chemical pollutants , flow of skull fights .
and when it &apos;s struggled through the system , and that leaves the water is clean than it came in .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only a farm that measures their success in the health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a water treatment plant , not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water flows out , it decreases in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to do , because this love story , like romantically , is also closing .
you might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bark or meat beef .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , of one that actually tastes good for food .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not realists ; we &apos;re enjoyable . we &apos;re lovers .
we love farmers &apos; markets . we love small family business . we talk about local food . we eat bio .
and if you &apos;re saying that these are the things that insure the future of good food is somewhere and says , &quot; hey folks , i love pinke flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
should i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
a billion people are starving today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of crasser inequalities in the distribution , not the overall production .
well , i don &apos;t like this question , because it has defined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feeds of vegetable feeders , skull combat substitute for monocultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken of fish , and all the time the agricultural industry simply asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the justification . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what she is , a commercial in retrieval , a commercial that detects rapidly ecological capital that allows this exact production .
this is not a trade , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our cornchamber is threatened today , not by engaging , but by engaging resources .
not by the latest mid-stress and tractor-inventions , but by fruit land , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by chainsaws , but by forests , and not by fishing boats , but by fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are obenan , and it has never really made a good thing to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is the one that reaches back to two billion years of labor .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
motors that are not worlds for themselves , who repair , rather than using , operations that grow extensiv rather than just intense , farmers that are not only generators , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts in taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest with you , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , i &apos;m right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i &apos;m going to close to you today , it &apos;s that all of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about information overlapping , i want you to think about how we can use information in that way that pattern and we can &apos;t see the trends .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical mortality diagram arranged to age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot , and what i can do with pivot is i can filter after a certain death cause , we say accidents .
and immediately , i see a different pattern that builds up .
and that is , because in the middle area here , people are the most active , and they are the most computational over here .
we can go out one step further and rearrange the data and see that circulatory conditions and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for anybody .
now , as we go on and sort of about age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main thing that people should worry about .
and who &apos;s been studying that this is particularly true to men .
so you can see that looking at information and data in this way is very much reminiscent of swimming in a life-information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why can &apos;t it be content itself ?
so what we have here is the front pictures of every single &quot; sports illustrated &quot; that have ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it after my talk in your rooms .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a certain year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , when i look at this , i see the athletes coming out and the sports .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i &apos;m going to click around for all of my expenses in which lance armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i just want to get a bigger overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything in the topic of bike driving ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back , and i &apos;m also getting the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea that if you go through this kind of information , targeted , wider , cleaners , you zoom out , you don &apos;t search , you don &apos;t just browse .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
now i want to take this idea a little bit further with something a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedias , and we &apos;ve reduced it to a little summary .
the summary contains a short overview and a symbol of the range from which it comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the most popular wikipedians .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are most popular to wikipedia .
now i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
well , after i chose the government , i know that the wikipediakategories that are most of the time magazine people of the year .
this is really important , because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t have a single wikipedian eggs .
that &apos;s just to see when you go back and you look at the whole thing .
looking at a particular summaries of these summaries , i can then go into the theme of time magazine &quot; people of the year , &quot; and see everybody together .
now , if i look at all of these people , i realize that the vast majority of them are government officials . some come from science . some , even less , come out of the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes out of the music .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
this is how we can now jump and take a look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we surfing the net the first time that it &apos;s really a network , not just from side to side , but a lot more abstract .
and so i want to show you something else that might be a little bit of a surprise .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website here .
so pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we take this zoom-technology to every single website like this .
so i can take a step back and jump directly to a specific section .
and that &apos;s important , because it &apos;s only through looking at websites in this way , you can look at all the internet trajectory in the same way .
so i can zoom in on my passenger in a certain time frame .
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration i &apos;ve stayed up to this .
and i can sort of repeat everything i &apos;ve looked at today , bring back .
and , again , if i take a step out and look at everything , maybe i can rearrange my trajectory for my search past . here , i went to &apos; nepotistic , &quot; looking for bing , or here in live labs pivos .
and from here , i can go inside and recall them .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s being used over and over and over , and every time it makes the overall image greater than the sum of the date .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the escape of information overflow .
we talk about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation around and turn the internet upside down , so that instead of walking from one to another , we start to go from lots of things to lots of things , and by seeing patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then this previous data trap , maybe a new source of information becomes meaningful .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge out of it .
and if we know it , then maybe we can even draw from it .
so i &apos;m going to end with it , thank you very much .
i grew up with a heard portion of science fiction .
in my school , i was driving to school with the bus every day , an hour per track .
and my nose was always in a book , a science fiction book , which blew my thoughts into other worlds , and in a narrative way , my shallow in myself , unbearable curiosity to satisfy .
and this curiosity also showed that , if i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests of road , i walked and sampled &quot; samples , frogs and snakes and beetles and ponds , all taken home and looked at under the microscope .
i was totally enthusiastic , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and to spin the limits of possible .
and my love of science fiction appeared in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that were showing us animals and places and a world of wonder we could never imagine before .
and i think that &apos;s what i think has adapted to that science-fiction role .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since it wasn &apos;t video games or this oversaturation with computer-generated movies , nor did all the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
we all had to do that at the time . when we read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and we put it on the canvas in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and painting aliens , aliens worlds , robots , spacecraft and all this .
in math class , i was always caught by the teacher , as i was hiding behind textbook , painting around .
creativity somehow had to go out .
and something interesting happened , which fascinated me on jacques cousteaus shows , which was the idea of an unknown world here on our own earth .
i certainly would never get to an extraterrestrial world with a spaceship , and it seemed quite unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on earth , and she was just as fascinating and exotic as all that i had always imagined when i had read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , to become deaf .
the only problem with that was that i was living in a small village in canada , 1,000 kilometers away from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t have that discourageous to me .
i buffalo until he finally made a dove school in buffalo , new york , finally made a dove , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my dove door in a pool of ymca in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , but one real ocean , i only got to face two years later than we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years that have been blown away , i &apos;ve spent about three thousand hours underwater , 500 hours of this in submersibles .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat ocean , is as rich in fascinating life as we really can &apos;t imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , as opposed to our own , explicit human imagination .
to this day , i have a profound awe of what i see on my dives .
and my love lasts on the ocean with the same level of intensity as eh and ever .
and then when i was an adult looking for a profession , it was filmmaking .
that seemed the best way to unite my inner inner , to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a kid , i constantly drew comic books and stuff .
so movies were way to bring images and stories together . the fit together .
of course , the stories i chose were from the science-fiction area : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
at &quot; abyss , &quot; i was able to connect my preliminary love for the underwater world and diving with the filmmaking .
so basically my two passions flown away .
something interesting happened at &quot; abyss &quot; : to solve a narrative problem in this movie -- which is that we had to create a kind of liquid water creature -- we put on computer-generated animation , cg , back .
and what came out of this was the first computer-generated software surface-figure ever to see in a movie .
now , the movie didn &apos;t bring any money , and he was actually playing his production cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotized by the magic that was coming out of it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know , advanced technology and magic are not too different from each other .
so they saw something magical .
and that &apos;s what i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , this must necessarily be involved in film art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next movie , much further .
together with ilm , we created the guy of liquid metal there , and the success just depended on how this effect was going to arrive .
and it worked . again , we had created something magic , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we &apos;ve had a little bit more money playing with the movie .
and from those two experiences , there was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for creating .
so i started a company , along with my good friend stan winston , who was the best makeup and creature-designer at that time . it was called digital domain .
the basic idea of this company was to jump through the phase analog processes with optical prints , etc . , and start to start with digital productions .
and that &apos;s what we did , and then we managed to create a competitive advantage for a while .
but in the mid-1990s , we realized that we were in the creature- and charter design -- where we actually started the company -- we got too slow to start .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the brass in visual effects and computer-generated effects in a whole new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that had been made by the cg , and the characters should be call the world .
but the bold said very nicely back in my company , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not yet able to do that .
so i shifted this , and i made this different movie about the big ship that goes on .
the movie studio i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship . &quot; it became a love movie of the epic paper , a passionate movie .
but in secret , i really wanted to dive down to the real retinal of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i convinced you , by saying , &quot; we dive to the wreck . we &apos;re shooting the real wreck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
that &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good record for marketing . &quot;
and i talked them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to the fact that your imagination can make a reality .
we then created a reality , actually six months later , where i found myself in a russian dive boat , looking at four kilometers under the surface of the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a bulleye .
this was not a movie , no hd , that was real .
so , that really blew my mind .
and the preparation for that was enormous . we had to build cameras and headlights and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how these deep sea traits were similar to space mission .
well , they were also highly technical and persistent planning .
you get to that capsule , and then you float down into this dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope for rescue if you don &apos;t create it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science-fiction movie .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway , part of the kind of curiosity and science has been . it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing outside the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that hadn &apos;t seen before , and the science at the time we saw them had never found words .
so that got me right there , and i wanted to do more .
and so i made a little unusual decision .
so after the success of titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main job as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice and i &apos;m going to go for a while full-time researcher . &quot;
and then we started , we showed up to the bismarck , and we explored them with robots .
we returned to the wreck of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built to make a fiberglass cable .
our purpose was to dive in and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the wreck . you didn &apos;t have any means for that . so we developed the technology we needed .
well , i &apos;m sitting here , on the deck of the titanic , in a dive boat , and i &apos;m looking at planks that are pretty similar to these brakes , and i know that once the band was playing there .
and i &apos;m flying with a little robotic experience through the gears of the ship .
i &apos;m actually just suggesting it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically within the ship wreck of the titanic .
this was the most surreal form of a déj<UNK> vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i get around a corner , i always knew what was going to happen in the light cone of the vehicle , because i took over a month of movie , when we were making the movie .
because the set was an accurate copy of the blueprint of the ship .
so this was a highly strange experience .
and she made me aware of this telepresence experience that you can use such robotic avatar , and so your consciousness into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really profound .
and maybe a little review of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg body to explore something or do other things , in all kinds of post-liberators , which i think of as a science-fi-fiction fan .
so after these expeditions , we started to really appreciate what we &apos;ve seen down there , really appreciate , such as these deep sectors , where we &apos;ve seen these incredibly amazing animals , and these are sort of aliens , but here on earth .
they live with chemosynthesis help .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunset system that we do .
and this is how you see animals , right next to a 500 degree centigrade , that they can survive there .
in the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was again the science fiction of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and who have to do with nasa and are sitting in the nasa review council and plan real space missions . they go to russia , and they go through the mission to the biomedical protocols and then they go to the international camerocity .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of it , it turned out that i took space scientists to the deep sea with us .
i took them with them , and then i took them access to the bottom of the world : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the sources so they could look around , samples and test instruments and so on .
well , we turned documentary films , but actually science , actually , to the point of it , is space science .
so the circle between my existence was a science fiction fan , then as a child , and the implementation in reality .
in the course of this voyage of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re thinking a director must also lead , being a leader like a ship apitarian or something .
i didn &apos;t really understand much of leadership before i took these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out of it ? &quot;
these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of production . there &apos;s no trace from rhm .
everyone thinks i was between titanic and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and somewhere i would have celebrated the nails on a towel on a beach somewhere .
i &apos;ve done all these films , these documentary films for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re going to do it for the purpose of the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that is there . you make it of discovery , and because of the odd connection that comes out when a small group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all of this with only 10 to 12 people who &apos;ve been working uninterrupted for years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been two to three months back on sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the awareness you have in front of each other , because you &apos;ve formulated a job that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
if you go back to land and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the faint , and the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human capacity , if you &apos;re working on the sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain the other way . how do it or the policemen .
there is a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to make my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and you deserve yourself in the opposite of it .
and this has really changed the dynamic .
so again , i stood with a small team on unknown terrain . we drew &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that was not there before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a four-and-a-half period for a four-and-a-half period of a correct family .
and it changed my way of making films completely .
there were people who were thinking that we really would have done these oceans , and transported them really well on the planet pandora .
for me , it was more a kind of a principle way of doing my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we get from all of this ?
what lessons have we learned ?
i think the first one is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature .
our imagination is a force that can even make a reality .
and the awareness of your team is more important than any lorbeer in the world .
coming to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a council like i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t ask yourself .
some people care about you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a favorite sentence : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art , and by exploring , failure has to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a guarantee about it .
no important undertaking , demanding innovation , has never occurred without risk .
you have to be ready to take risks like this .
this is the thought i &apos;d like to spend with you on the way . failure is through an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise , because my full-time employment in the foundation is mainly circling vaccines and seed to enable the things that we invent and provide to enable the poorest two billion lives to make a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than anyone else on the planet .
climate impairment means that their saats are not going to grow for many years , it &apos;s too much or too little rain , and things will change in the same way that their fragile environment cannot sustain .
this leads to starvation . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , climate change will become terrible for them .
and also , energy agency is very important to you .
the fact is that if you could only reduce the price from one thing , you could reduce your poverty reducing energy by far the most effective .
well , energy evolution has fallen over time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy progresses .
the coal evolution turned on the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity cycle , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air conditions , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation of electricity in the rich world .
but if we lower the price -- let &apos;s cut the price in half -- we hit a new barrier , and that barrier is related to co2 .
co2 warms the planet , and the equation of co2 is actually pretty clear .
they add up the stolen co2 that leads to the temperature rate , and that increase in temperature has a few very negative effects , effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the indirects that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to these rapid changes and collapse systems .
now , the exact relationship between a carbon dioxide increase and the exact temperature shift , and where the other implications are , there are some ambiguity , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i asked the top scientists several times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
don &apos;t cut half or a quarter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will go further .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying we have a three-inch truck , which needs to be put under a three-foot bridge , and you can kind of squeeze underneath it .
this has to go down , to zero .
well , we run out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
each american is about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for each of the planet .
and somehow we have to make changes that down to zero .
it has gone constant .
only different economic changes have influenced it at all , and we have to go from rapid progressing and going to a decrease to zero .
this equation has four factors . it &apos;s a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- carbon that you want to take to zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people who use average energy and the co2 per unit of energy .
so let &apos;s look at each factor and think about how we get that to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and it &apos;s written on nine billion . it &apos;s moving to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , health prevention and reproduction medicine , we might be able to reduce that by 10 percent to 15 percent , but right now we &apos;re going to see a tilt by 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
that includes everything we eat , the food we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things and poverty reduction is to make these services accessible to almost everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that that number goes up .
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to divert and use less , but on average , that number is going to go up every year and doubling more than doubling , the number of services are being provided per person .
here we see a very basic service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their high school assignments under the street .
well , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s good news .
we have something that &apos;s not rising .
because of different successes in the light sector , by other autotypes , by building new methods in the house , there are a lot of services whose energy output some individual services can be reduced by 90 percent .
in other services , like the manufacturing of fertilizers , 105 : 05 : 56,000 -- 00 -- 00 : 05 : 58,000 or air traffic or air transport , the playspace is much smaller for improvement .
overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction by a factor of three or maybe even a factor of six .
but for the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to maybe first 13 billion tons now , and that &apos;s just not good enough !
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 emitted per unit of energy .
the question is , can you get this down to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method for power is today emitting co2 , except for renewables and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy miracles .
now , if i use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
usually there is no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
normally you &apos;re just dangling and some come , some people don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to give full gas and get a miracle in a very short amount of time .
well , i was wondering , how can i really get this over ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that takes the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow people liked it .
the idea became really tangible to you , you know that there are people who live with mosquitoes .
and for energy , this is what i came up with .
i decided that this was going to be a free piece of fireflies in this year &apos;s contribution to the environment .
so here &apos;s some natural fireflies .
i have made sure they don &apos;t bite . they probably won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of playful solutions like this , but they all don &apos;t do much .
we need solutions , either one or another , that have an unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliability , and even though there are many directions in which people are looking for it , i really only see five that can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left twice , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
they may afford a moderate contribution , and if they do better than i expect it would be great , but my point here is that we have to work on all those five people , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they shy us , because they have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there seems to be easy , but it &apos;s not . you have to get all the co2 that &apos;s coming out of your jurisdiction , catch under pressure and then laugh , and then somewhere , and hope it &apos;s going to be there .
there are some pilot projects that can do that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but get it to 100 percent is going to be very difficult . and an agreement for the accomplishment of co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the overall question .
who will make it safe ?
who can guarantee what literally billions of times larger than any kind of garbage you can think of nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough nut .
next , nuclear energy .
it &apos;s also got three big problems . the cost , especially high in high-regulation countries , and the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human contribution that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work on .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of the five .
it &apos;s the renewables , as they &apos;re frequently called .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that makes these technologies dramatically lower than the power plants .
that &apos;s energetic , you talk about lots of square miles , 1,000 times more area than a regular power station .
and also , these sources of interruptions .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and it doesn &apos;t seem all the time the wind doesn &apos;t shine all the time .
that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have a way to get energy even if you &apos;re not available in time .
so there are big price challenges here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say , for example , the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you also have to deal with the risk that energy comes from where else comes from .
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve looked at all sorts of batteries that are made , looking at cars , computers , cell phones , pocklips , everything . and that &apos;s what i have done with the amount of electronic energy which uses the world . i found out that we could make the batteria whole 10 minutes .
so what we need here is a big breakthrough , something that is going to be 100 times better than the approaches of time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these interrupted sources , say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
if you want to support for 100 percent , you need an incredible wonder battery .
now , where should we go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
for many of you will say they &apos;re nuts ! that &apos;s good .
i think there are many that are already involved in the ted group .
bill gross has several companies , among other things , called esolar , who has great solar thermal technologies .
vinence khosla is investing in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting opportunities , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i &apos;m funding a company that , perhaps surprisingly enough , follows the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuclear realm ; modular , liquid .
the development stopped in this industry a while ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
the terrapower-concept means that instead of being a part of the uran , the one percent that u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent that u238 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you had thought about this for a long time , but you could never reasonably simulate whether it was going to work , but ever since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes ! with the right material approach , it looks like it .
and because you burn that 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better cost .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as a compound .
instead of breaking the head over it , they just burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
the uranium is being used gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of pillar , which is often called &quot; micrating wave reactor . &quot;
that really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of an orange in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s being burned today , so it &apos;s called a decreased uran .
this is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and when you make ocean inexpensive and easy to filtrate , you get enough fuel for the rest of the life of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to reach , and then we talk about the intermediate step .
many are speaking of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent are going to be produced in poor countries , and still a little bit of agriculture , and hopefully whale drugs and cement will be clean up until then .
so in order to accomplish that 80 percent , the industrial countries , including countries like china , have to completely replace their electricity generation .
the other note is whether we &apos;re using zero-emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed world , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest of it .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key element in this education .
if we go back from there , what should that look like in 2020 tea ?
it should include the two elements again .
we should use the effectiveness measures to get reduction on our way , and the less we emitting , the less the carbon co2 is going to be , and also the temperature .
but actually this note to the things that we do is not completely lead to the great reductions , just the same , or even a little bit less important than the other ones that demonstrate the speed of innovation for these persistence .
these breakthroughs have to track full gas , and we can measure this : in corporate numbers , in mushroom projects and regulation changes .
there are a lot of great books on this topic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david mckays &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
they really go through and they create a framework where this can be discussed , because we need support for all sides .
there &apos;s a few things that have to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you just allowed me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love it , or i could choose that wish , which is , half-energy emission without co2 was going to produce that wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the digging between the longer-term and the short-term people will get terrible , between the united states and china , between the poor and the rich , and almost all of those two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what kind of measures do i appeal to ?
we need to use for more research .
when countries meet in places like coppenhages , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk about this innovation strategy , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous funds that will be spent on these innovative ways of approach .
we need market incentives , carbon taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade , something that creates a price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we have to have dialogue rational and complete , and also the things that are done by government .
it &apos;s a big wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand terrapower a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us a sense of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it works reasonably , you &apos;re only in 10 million .
the hard step is to build the first reactor , find another billion , the regularia and the place that actually makes the first one .
once the first thing is done , when it runs like promises , it &apos;s all clear , because the economic , the energy density is so different from nuclear energy as we know it .
to really understand that , it means to build deep down into the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel , this consumed urans , and then the process is starting to work further down ?
bg : right . now you have to refill the reactor ever , so there are lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it and bring things in or out . that &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- that they buried without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it &apos;s burning for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear reactor who provides a solution to the trash .
bg : yeah . well , what happens to the trash : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and you put it in the next reactor , and you burn it on .
and we start by taking the waste that already exists , which is in these refrigerators or dry containers in the reactors . that &apos;s our strong fuel .
so what &apos;s a problem for these reactors is that what we fill in our fills , and it &apos;s dramatically reduced the waste volume as this process .
but as they &apos;ve been talking to different people around the world about these possibilities .
where is the greatest interest in what is really going to do ?
bg : well we haven &apos;t figured out a place yet , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting openness rules for everything called nuclear . there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company in russia , india , i was here , and i &apos;ve talked about the energy economy .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have made something along the way .
this is a variant of one thing that has been done .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built it , so everyone who has implemented a quick reactor , a candidate for our first one .
in your mind , timeline and likelihood really bring something to life ?
bg : now we need one of these scalable , current things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then use 20 years .
this is sort of the deadline that has shown us the environmental models that we have to stay in .
and , you know , terrapower , if it &apos;s all going well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could make it easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds , which , equally , if their approaches work , will be able to support the funds for their pilots .
and it would be best if it could be multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
and the great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : a breakthrough is the most important thing .
it would have been without the world &apos;s demand , but it makes it so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor type that seems a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about this is that a uranium has a million times as much energy as an energy , say , a cow molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , which is mostly the radiation and the cost , the power , the impact , and the other things , is happening .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what then ?
do we have to inform emergency measures to try and keep the temperature stable ?
bg : when you get to this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;re eating too much , and you &apos;re just in front of a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a cardiac surgery , or something like that .
there &apos;s a research facility called geoengineering , which is dealing with various techniques to delay warming so that we could get 20 or 30 years longer to come together .
this is just an insurance method .
we &apos;re hoping we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t work first on insurance , because maybe you &apos;re making lazy , so you keep eating because you know that you &apos;re going to save your heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re looking at the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that available , if things get faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
climate maskeptics : do you have one or two sentences for those to maybe convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those of you who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things you can even tell , of which there &apos;s an opportunity in a million .
the main problem here is kind of like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems to invest in something that you only have later on -- and the investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario and there are people in the rich world .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , co2 is falling , the skeptics also say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it that &apos;s not co2 emitted , i wish it &apos;s almost that it did , but i &apos;m going to accomplish it , because it &apos;s cheaper .
and that would be their answer to the björn lomborg argument , that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer from the poverty reducing , the fierce of malaria and so on that there &apos;s a dumb of resources to invest .
bg : well , the actual expenditure of research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you do today -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
among them , other things should not suffer .
you come to big money , and here you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and you &apos;re trying to fund that , for me , most of the waste is going on .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short in front of a cost breakthrough and you just pay for the learning curve , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the drag you get , it &apos;s a very high power episode , then only the rich ones can keep up .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing the lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
his new masses now is , &quot; why isn &apos;t research reviewed ? &quot;
he &apos;s still associated with , because of his earlier stories associated with the skeptical camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and so he now has an argument in the research .
and this is a contempt that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just nuts , how little the support is being supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking for almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter skillman introduced a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . four-odd teams have to build the biggest steady structure with 20 spaghetti , about a meter tape , about three feet of fact and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on the top .
and even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s really hard to do it , because it urges people to work very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos &apos; 50-company company , and there &apos;s something about this task that enables deep impressions to work with them , and i want to share some of them .
usually most people are starting to orient themselves in terms of the task .
they &apos;re talking about what it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s making power .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they sketch and they expose spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the builduration of the structures .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and you put it coalesce on the top , step back and da-da ! you admire your work .
but what happens , almost all the time , is that the ta-da is going to be &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallows causes the whole thing to fade and plummeted .
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst , fresh bwl &apos;s graduates .
they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused , and they create really dward-to-date shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; ta-da &quot; and the best ones are women &apos;s fun of kindergarten .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , she doesn &apos;t only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , how does that come ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the kids are investing in the chief of the spaghetti gmbh . &quot;
they &apos;re not investing time in power fights .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that bwl students were trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then to realize it .
so what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what kindergarten kids do differently is they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they have multiple times the possibility of fixing bloody prototypes .
constructionists recognize this kind of collaboration as the heart of an iterative process .
and with each trial , the children get immediately the feedback that works and what doesn &apos;t .
so the power of working with prototypes is central -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are acting .
most of them are about 50 inches , bwl-students , half of them , lawyers are a little bit more , but not much , child children are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , luckily .
one meter is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and secure self-reinforcing geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ceos is about average . but this is where it gets interesting .
if you put an executive administrator on the team , they will better be significant .
it &apos;s amazing . you look around and you see , &quot; this team is going to win . &quot;
you can predict the future . why is that possible ?
because they have special skills from processing .
they lead the process ; they understand it .
and that team that regulates and on work is going to improve teams &apos;s performance significant .
so specialized skills and processing skills and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typically occurring , you get about six that have stable structures .
i tried something more exciting .
i thought , well , let &apos;s put the poker deploy in the same way .
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize software for the winners .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if any one had built a five-inch construction , it would have carried the prize home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competitions have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
so what do you think happened ?
now they understood the advantage of prototyping .
that &apos;s how the same bad team became one among the best .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
so there are profound lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually create time to create a marshmallow challenge ?
the reason i &apos;m creating digital tools and processes is to help teams , create cars , video games and visual effects .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , or maintaining , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in it can go to marshmallowchallenge.com .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the marshmallows .
there &apos;s a step-by-step instruction there .
they find crazy examples from all over the world , how people optimize and repair the system .
there are also world records .
and the base lesson , i think , is that construction is actually a connection of sports .
it demands that we &apos;re all using our senses to the task , and that we &apos;re using our thinking optimal , how our feelings and our things , the challenge we &apos;re facing .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all it takes to take us from &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool ted machine , and this is a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i often asked my friends in the last time , and they all wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back in time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america is looking for the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that somehow you &apos;ve moved to the nostalgia , to weekly .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventurer .
it &apos;s because opportunities don &apos;t go back on this planet ; they go forward .
so i want to go to this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time ever existed on the planet , no matter what scale you &apos;re going to do : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining disease .
there had never been a time like this before .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70.
my parents are the 80 on the rivers .
so there should be better a nine in the beginning of my death .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a kid who can be born in new delhi today , expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . it &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;ve gone .
we forced them . puff .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us have not yet threatened before a generation .
diphterie , rodent , child-paralysis ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of the scientific method .
and from my point of view , the scientific method is to try things , see if it works , it changes when it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news already , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioning a lot .
and one of them is that , despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world are hungry to bed every day .
that number goes up , and it goes up very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to really devastate this world .
drinking water , urable land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear soon , and if we don &apos;t let us out of this chaos , we &apos;re also disappearing .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think we can do that .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that &apos;s going to feed billions of people without the country they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destroy it at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a weekly thinking .
but this is what keeps me at night -- one of the things that keeps me awake at night . we &apos;ve never needed any scientific advancement as it is now , never before .
and we &apos;ve never been able to use it reasonably the way we can do it today .
we &apos;re amazed at the threshold , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think we have hundreds , 300 years before the enlightenment have been going back to find a time in which we have made progress that we have done more and more fronts in which we have done this stuff .
people hire themselves in their belief , and it &apos;s so tightly that you can &apos;t free them .
it &apos;s not even the truth to free it .
and listen , everybody has a right to his mind ; even a right to make sense of progress .
but you know what they &apos;re not right on ?
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; &quot; training , don &apos;t have them .
and i took a while to figure that out .
i wrote an article about a decade ago about &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to find resistance , resistant to what is the most effective measure in human health history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did whatever i was doing , i wrote an article and ran away .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetically modified food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing mad .
so i also wrote an article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that this was &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules were going to move around in a certain way , instead of shooting a head-of-the-art .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we cut in , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but i was worried about these articles , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i figured it out .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that made me mad weren &apos;t a fanatics at all .
these were thoughtful people , represented people , consistent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me through like this .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
we got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we &apos;re speeding by twin twins .
we &apos;re talking ironic about this , with little leadership about this : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what reasons that are .
we have the confidence in institutions , authority , and sometimes they have lost in science , and there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just name some names and people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the u.s. presidential election in 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we believed that they would be right , so be skeptical .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but now , when you get the evidence , you have to embrace this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say this for the reason that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully never seen again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that brought the autism epidemic with the masses , mumps , and the tube vaccine together .
very frightening .
so studies have been done to see if that was true .
so studies should be done well ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see what we believe in seeing what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a bundle of documents from a government who gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was catastrophic .
disaster because of this fact : the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccination for masses decline is falling .
that &apos;s scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand . i do .
because does anybody have masses here ?
did a single person in the audience ever see someone die of masses ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death in masses , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can displace it , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and messages of fear and illiteracy of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and you can do that because you can &apos;t combine cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem equal , but almost never the same .
and this is something that we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of humanity &apos;s worst spirits .
no fear , no torture , child paralysis , puff , disappeared .
it &apos;s not that much the guy in the middle .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
he &apos;s just developed a rotavirus-vaccine with a few other people .
it can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul &apos;s walking around talking about vaccines and saying how valuable they are , and people should just stop getting around .
and that &apos;s what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul speaks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t say without armed sentences .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where to go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are impaired .
if you continue to reverse the diseases , horrible diseases , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now .
we now have masses in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die back to this , because that &apos;s just a matter of numbers .
and they &apos;re not only going to die of masses .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a commiliton of mine wrote me a couple of weeks ago , and she said , &quot; i think i &apos;m a little bit too shit . &quot;
no one &apos;s ever said this .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against child paralysis . no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have child paralysis . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have child paralysis in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in lagos would go on an airplane this morning and fly to los angeles right now , at the moment he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and rent a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fabulous ted dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to encounter ourselves in lies . we love that .
did you all take their vitamins this morning ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium that helps you on the leaps .
i know you did this because half of americans do it every day .
they take this stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out they &apos;re useless .
the data shows it all the time .
they evaporate their judgment . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with them .
dark dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system is rent .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazingly cold and disastrous to ourselves that can afford it .
so we &apos;re going before , and where are we going ?
we &apos;re running into the poor of the placebo industry .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , it &apos;s a really serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
none of them -- gingko , fraud , echinacea , fraud , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars on it ; it &apos;s fraud .
and you know what ? when i say that , people will shout me and say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what you want .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the minister of health , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to adopt the evidence of my mammography , &quot; or any cancer quack that wants to treat his patients with caffes .
if you &apos;re going to be on this path where i think and replace magic and science , you &apos;re going to get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they go to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he killed 400,000 of his people , because he insisted that red beef , bone also and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know can overcome the course of aids braking .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary death in a country that gets worse than any other one of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the brain losoust epidemic that we &apos;re in right now is this absurd struggle between the worthy of genetic alternating food and the bio-elite .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every rice , every branch of peterey , every red coin , has been changed by the people .
you know , we didn &apos;t have mandarins in paradise .
there were no cantaloupe-melons .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1,000 years .
and some of it didn &apos;t work and some of it didn &apos;t .
we &apos;ve gotten rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can make it closer . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , extending their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we refuse tensically altered food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly listening to is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormonoculture , monoculture , we don &apos;t want a huge fields of one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patentkram .
you know science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work and sometimes , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re scared of a real thing , and it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we are right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
shame . shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this devastated stuff , like maniok .
maniok is something that &apos;s eating half a billion people .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bundle of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it has no nutrients ; it has no protein , and scientists are building all this stuff in it .
and then people could eat this , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panisse , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say to that is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
it &apos;s not to move genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insights on larger food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about maintaining people alive , and it &apos;s going to be very time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to do the way we do something guilty about , i think we don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our fault , and we have to really stop that .
so after this incredibly funny entertainment , you might want to say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway . i certainly want that .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want to go .
we have to have these conversations , and we have to think , but if we go into the time machine , and we &apos;re going to be happy to do that .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , this is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . it may seem odd that a magician &apos;s interested in it , unless you look at it as &quot; a deception that becomes something that &apos;s actually thought of only enough . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect in some studies , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s just because the person thinks what &apos;s happening to them is a pharmaceutical or a kind of -- in pain management , for example , if the patient is paying attention to it .
there &apos;s a deception going to be something that &apos;s true , because somebody perceives it like this .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to show you a very basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been at least in the 1950s in every textbook for children .
i learned him from the cub scout magic of the pfadfinder in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife like this in my hands .
i &apos;m going to push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or comes out of it , i &apos;m just going to put my wrist right here .
this is how you can see that no time moves anything , and as long as i feel here , there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve or coming out of my sleeve .
and the goal here is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is fine , the knife is held by my mere body magnetism .
it actually sits so hard in its place that i can shake it without the knife falling down .
there &apos;s nothing going on in my sleeve or coming out , not a freaky , and you can study everything .
ta-da !
now , this is a trick i often teach young kids that are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closer , even though it &apos;s a very easy thing to do .
i think many of you probably know this trick here .
it works like this .
i &apos;m holding the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m ending my wrist to make sure that nothing will disappear in my sleeves or come out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i compensate my wrist is because it &apos;s really the secret of illusion .
because the moment i turn my hand away from them , so you can see them behind , that finger is moving here , my timeline , just from where it was , in a position where it &apos;s pushed out .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone sitting in the back there who had no childhood .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you can &apos;t perceive that there &apos;s only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it does information , it doesn &apos;t include it , one , two , three , it &apos;s shown as a group .
but that &apos;s not what this is all about , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s held there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , through my finger that is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back , is blocked by this movement that fingers are moving back again .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
you can do this trick to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
a year ago or so , i was reading a study that really blew my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing .
and what it turns out is that if you offer a placebo in a white pill form , in the form of an aspiratory pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular scaffolding effect .
but if you change the shape in which you give the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and those blue color color and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurably more effective .
and that , even though none of these are any pharmaceutical -- it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me freak out .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all yet .
when you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than pills of any shape .
a colored capsule which is at the end of a yellow and on the other red is better than a white capsule .
the dosage also plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics now . sorry .
but the thing is , ...
... that too , the doses play a role .
and the form plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with an ingenuity -- a few milliliters of an effective substance that you inject to a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of that has any really pharmaceutical property . it &apos;s just our belief in creating a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and make it look real .
well , we know from that study that you have to reach the needle if it &apos;s going to go to the point .
this is an 18 inch long hat needle . it &apos;s very , very tight . and i &apos;m going to minimize them a little bit of sterilize first .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not damians &apos;s special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a specialty effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m now going to stick this needle into my skin and float through it until it controls back on the other side .
if you get smarter -- if you fall in faints -- i showed this a few friends last night in the hotel room and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman has become almost audacious .
so i propose that if you get quick , you look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first holy bit behind here .
you can see it the same , but you can also see away if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like this , right here where my flesh starts , on the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little one-hour guy .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it insane ?
and now just a little bit of it through my skin and then on the other side , it &apos;s like this again .
now we &apos;re actually in the same kind of situation that we had when we got the measurement trick .
roughly .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not that stupid and it &apos;s going to go through even the skin just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back , they say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see this right . &quot;
the people in the side are coming in now .
let me show you from near it .
this is really my skin . this is not a specialty effect from hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can turn this around .
i &apos;m sorry . if you get scared , look away , don &apos;t look .
the people in the back or the ones that look a little bit later on video will say , &quot; well , that looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , he would -- you see , there &apos;s a hole and there , if it was real , it would flower . &quot;
okay , let me squeeze a little bit of blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i would usually take out the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no lesions .
but i think , in this framework here and the purpose of making a deception a real thing , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple more times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
everyone &apos;s speaking today about happiness .
i &apos;ve let some people count the numbers of books that have been published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title for the last five years , and they spent about 40 , and there were many more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
everyone would like to make people happier .
but despite all this tide of work , there are multiple cognitive traits that are sort of impossible to think clearly about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly about these cognitive trade-offs .
this is true for layas , thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just as confused as any other .
the first of these falls is an ambition to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to lots of different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain sense that we could constraint it , but in the large and all of this , this is something that we have to be given up , and we will have to embrace the complicated view of what is on the well-being .
the second trap is a conversion of experience and memory : basically you &apos;re between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both compiled in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the concentration illusion , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its significance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he heard a sinfony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and the end of the picture was a terrible sound .
and then he added in , really quite emotionally , which ruined all of the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of glorious music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was connected with memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he could get to keep .
what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two types of self .
there is a living self who lives in the present and knows the present is able to experience the past again , but basically only the present .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor picks -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; is it going to hurt now if i summarize you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and the memory self is this , which counts and receives the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor talks to by asking the question , &quot; how have you felt in the last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the living self and the memory itself , and changing the two is part of the diarrhea of happiness .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
and this really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts right now .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we make us tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we can retain from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who participate in a painful procedure .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report their pain every 60 seconds .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who suffered more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has suffered , clearly , and his reflection was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse reference to the mirror as a patient b.
the stories of representation were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very build-up or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the one who was worse is where the pain was at the very end of his climax . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people about their reflection , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing overall ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than for b in the memory .
now , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memory of self .
from a living self &apos;s point of view , clearly had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been made , and it works , you could actually extend the mirror of patient a by just putting the mud in there without even being too much tired of it .
this is going to lead the patient &apos;s suffering , but only a little bit and a lot less than before .
and if you &apos;ve made that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve made that patient &apos;s living is worse on it , and you &apos;ve made the memory of patient a much better off , because now you &apos;ve given patient a better story about their experience . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
what is a story of ?
and this applies to the stories that memory provides us , and it applies to the stories that we invent .
what excuses a story about outbreaks , insidious moments and end .
end is very , very important and in this case domesticated the end .
well , the living self lives continuously .
it has moments of life , one by one .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they are lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i figured this out -- you know , the psychological present is true for about three seconds , which means that in a life , there are about 600 million of them . in a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t let any trace .
most of you are completely ignored by the memory self .
and yet , in a way , you get the sense that you should count that what happened during that moment of life has happened .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we use while we are in this world .
and how we consume it would seem to be very important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the memory of ourselves to us .
so we have the memory of ourselves and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is time to deal with .
from a living self &apos;s point of view , if you have a vacation , and the second week is as good as the first one , then the double-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation .
that &apos;s not how this works at all for remembering itself .
for even remembering , a double-stick vacation is barely better than a weekly vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories to be added .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a memory of self from a living self . time has very little influence on this story .
now , the memory itself makes more than remembering and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , who , say , had two mirrors in two different surgeons and decides which to vote , it &apos;s the one who chooses the memory that &apos;s less bad and it &apos;s the surgeon .
the living self doesn &apos;t have a voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think of the future , we don &apos;t normally think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future for predicted memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyrannei of the memory itself , and you can think of the memory of self as one that kind of draws the living self through experiences that don &apos;t need the living self .
i have the impression that when we &apos;re doing vacation , it &apos;s very often the case , which means we &apos;re making vacation largely in the service of self .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we eat from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given to the dominance of the memory itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think quite often about how many times i &apos;ve learned about other vacations .
and i probably have tossed my memories of this three-week journey , i would say for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s about a one-and-a-half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i might be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the toes of memories , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we have so much weight in the weight that we make experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your nearest vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation , all of your pictures are decreased and you get an amnestic drug , so you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you were to choose a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between their two types of self , and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about the senses of memory , you might get another answer .
why we chose the holidays that we &apos;re looking for is a problem that we have with a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two types of self drop two terms from happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use per self .
so you can ask : how happy is life itself ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the living yourself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
which is the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea about happiness of the living self over time .
if you ask about the happiness of your self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how content or pleased the person is when they think about their lives .
very different words .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms will mash the research of happiness , and i &apos;m involved in a lot of researchers about well-being , who have forgotten the research of happiness for a long time in the same way .
the distinction between the happiness of the living self and happiness of the memory itself has been detected in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate .
the gallup organization has a world survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of the two types of self .
and the main lesson that we &apos;ve learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you know how peace somebody is with his life , and that doesn &apos;t really teach them much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
what that means is that if you were to meet somebody , and you &apos;d tell them , oh , your father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about your height ?
well , you &apos;d know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much insecure .
if i tell you that somebody put their life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
so the correlation is low .
we know a little bit about what the happiness of happiness itself determines .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly about being satisfied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the luck of the two types of self , you will end up doing very different things .
the implication of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t think of happiness as being a replacement of well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very briefly , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people have to be happier in california , let &apos;s say , live in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the thinking self that decides how happy people are .
well , because the conceivable self is responsible , you can end up -- some people might end up going to california at the end .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who move to california in hope to become happier .
well , their living self is not going to get happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be remembered of how awful weather was in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel you &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
well , when we said on the phone a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of that gallup poll .
is this something that you can let us participate now , because you &apos;ve got a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we found in the gallup poll is a number that we had absolutely not expected to find .
we found that in terms of happiness of the living self .
when we looked at how sentiors vary feelings with income .
and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large record of americans , about 600,000 dollars , but it &apos;s a great representative sample under a 600,000 dollars a year from 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year people are unhappy , and they become increasingly unhappy , the poorer they become .
we get an absolutely flat line on that .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
what happens is it &apos;s obvious that money doesn &apos;t raise an experience happiness , but that scarcity of money will certainly make you miserable , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the memory itself , you get a different story .
the more money you earn the more happiness you are .
this is not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american quest , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this statement seriously , i mean , it seems to put it all on their head , everything we think , for example , in tax policy and so on .
is there a chance that politicians that the country , in general , would take a find as serious as it was , and would make politics based on this ?
dk : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
the recognition is going to be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries it &apos;s happening right now .
people are realizing that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to explore experience happiness or whether they want to explore food review , so we have to have this discussion pretty soon .
how to improve happiness is very different dependent on how you think and whether you think about the memory of your self , or whether you think about the living self .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you look at measuring the experience happiness of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next decade or two , part of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , it &apos;s going to be the topic , or should at least be the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m making computer games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , as it is to save in online games .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of you , to spend more time with playing bigger and great games .
we spend three billion hours a week online playing .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a whole bunch of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
in fact , for my research at the institute of the future , it &apos;s exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on the planet , we have to dramatically increase that time .
i &apos;ve calculated that the time took 21 billion hours of play per week .
this may seem a little bit abundant , so i &apos;ll repeat it so that if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture really describes why i believe games are so essential for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings in play . so he built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might have some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , a bit scared , but also first focus , really deep into solving a really difficult problem .
if you also play , you see some nuances here that are bloody eyes up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows are surprises .
this is a player standing on the verge of something called the epic victory .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
an epic victory is a result that is so positive that you didn &apos;t even know it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when they do it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually able to do something like that . that &apos;s an epic victory .
this is a player right in front of a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of problem-solvers all over the world , if we take the hurdle of the next century , the face of those who are dedicated to all the motives on the edge of an epic siege .
well , unfortunately , we look more like this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i refer it as the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; face . and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me doing &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; face .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied why we &apos;re better than in real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think that in reality , we &apos;re not as good as in games .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , even though that &apos;s part of it .
we &apos;re doing more worlds . i mean , in terms of motivation , doing something significant , inspired in collaboration with each other .
if we &apos;re in a games world , i think a lot of us will turn into our best version , at any time and ready to install the time , try and fix the problem as long as you need to do it again , after you can try it again .
and in reality , when we fail , when we find obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel overwhelmed . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
we never have these feelings when we play games , they just don &apos;t have them .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d. student .
why is it impossible to think in games , you could not just achieve everything ?
how can we transfer those feelings from the games into the reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to compete problems .
and i &apos;ve discovered some things that can make the epic victory in online worlds possible .
so , first of all , if you go into one of these online games , particularly at world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to trust you a world mission , right now .
but not only any mission , but a mission that is perfectly fond to your current level in the game , right ?
so they &apos;re going to do that .
you never get a task you can &apos;t do .
but always at the edges of their skills , so they have to get there , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around twitching . there &apos;s always an important thing to do .
and there &apos;s staff up there .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with you to close your epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that in real life so easy , this feeling that if you have a finger sweeping staff , you get ready .
furthermore , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story of why we are there and what we have to do .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve probably heard of &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + 1 starch , &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have plus-one speaking and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so , the problem of cooperative worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so gratifying at any time on the edge of an epic victory that we prefer to spend our entire time in these worlds .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of warcrafters have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in context , 5.93 million years ago , our first primate ancestors started to go upright .
so the first exciting primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend time playing now , it just makes sense when you think of time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinarily viable .
but it also turns out , because it turns out we use all this time on playing , actually changing what we are capable of as people .
we develop to collaborative thinking , cardiac creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
if you look at this interesting statistic that was published recently by a carnegie mellon university researcher , the average boy of today in a country with strong game culture is spending 10,000 hours of online games to the 21st year of life .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10,080 hours are the extent overall they spend in high school , from the fifth grade to the degree of high school -- if you never don &apos;t .
so here we have a complete paralleling way of learning about young people in the same way that it means to be a good player , like anything else you &apos;re learning in school .
and maybe some of you have read the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; fly overfly . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science , that if we spend 10,000 hours with mothering to a random subject to the 21st of life , we &apos;re going to master it .
we become so good at doing whatever the most important people in the world are .
so , what we have here is a full generation of young people who are master-players .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players championably good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have virtually never existed human potential before .
we have so many people right now in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing with online games .
these are our master players . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinarily good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry is designing consoles that save energy and work on mobile functions , rather than the broadband internet , so that players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , can play online .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players overall .
so i started to think about what it is , what it &apos;s like to do in us to master these games .
here are the four things i found . first of all , urgency optimism .
ok , so imagine how extreme self-motivation .
urgency optimism is the desire to immediately do something , master a hurdle , along with the belief that we have a strong hope for success .
players always believe that an epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in spiders poet social networks .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more after playing with them , even when they defeated us .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we believe that somebody has time with us that the rules will be held by us , that we will have the same goal and we will remain at the end of the game .
so the combination enables the growing of bonds , trust and each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
happy productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warcraft-player plays 22 hours a week , as a part-time job .
the reason is that , when we play , we &apos;re actually happier at working hard than if we relax or do nothing .
we know that we work as human beings optimal when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard if they get the right job .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to become part of awe viundant missions of planetary expressions .
here &apos;s a backgrocery formation to bring this to the right place . you know all of wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second largest wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 entries , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve compiled more information about the world of warcraft on the internet than they did about any other subject in any other wiki in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome , and players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as individuals .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward castronova is a folk scientist .
his work is brilliant . he &apos;s looking at why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we will witness less than a mass migration in virtual worlds and online games environments . &quot;
and this is from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
it &apos;s not like me -- i &apos;m developing games , i &apos;m a little exquisite .
so he says , actually , that makes sense , because players can do more online worlds than in real life .
they can tap into more powerful social attachments than they can live in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in games than they do in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical at the moment that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real world .
i &apos;ll just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
we have to start transforming the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that is 2,500 years back .
there are these ancient cues made out of sheep . you know ?
in front of these fantastic games controllers , there was sheep quakes .
and these were , kind of , the first of people developed gadgets .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of ancient greek historian herodotus , you might know this story . the story of how and why games were invented .
the game according to herodotus has been invented , more cubic fields , in the kingdom of lydias during a famine .
there was such a famine that the king of lydias decided to an insane idea .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the cube game and agreed a national strategy , and on one day you would eat food . the next day you would play .
and they would be so deeply immersed in the cube game , because games are so fascinating , and we &apos;ll be with peaceful , happy productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to herodotus , they survived this famine for 18 years by eating on a day and playing the next .
similarly , i think we &apos;re putting games together today .
we &apos;re going to use games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re using games to escape everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s really not satisfying in life , and we &apos;re going to pick up what we need from the games .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to herodotus , after 18 years , the famine was not better , so the king decided to use one last cubicle game .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they were playing a cube game , and the sieges were given to a epic adventure .
they were leaving lydias , and they were looking for a new home , and they were leaving as many people as they were able to survive , looking for the rest of a neighborhood where they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest dna evidence shows that the etrussians , who were later forming the roman empire , have the same dna as the old lydians .
so scientists recently came to the notion that herodotus &apos;s mad story actually agrees .
and geologists found evidence of a global hypothermia that took almost 20 years to explain famine .
so this crazy story could be right .
maybe they actually saved their people through games for 18 years , whispering in games , and then having that environment , and they learned so much about playing with each other , that they would have saved the entire civilization .
so , that &apos;s what we can do .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first strategy piece in real time in the world of warcrafts series . that was 16 years ago .
they &apos;ve been playing curock for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;d like to argue that we &apos;re ready to play for our own epic game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion game hours a week .
we should overcome that half of us spend an hour a day playing with games until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and i have dedicated my work in the last few years at the institute to the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , and it expresses how to understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try and tell the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then we empower people to implement this idea of reality .
we imagine epic victories and we give people the opportunity to achieve them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i designed to try and create epic vigs in your own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome an oil shortage .
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content to make it realistic , and they actually live their right lives without oil , so if they &apos;re going to cook up to the game , they tell us where they live , and then they &apos;re going to get some rewards in real-time that oil is not how they &apos;re going .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompaniing them for the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you get to say , &quot; we &apos;re going to oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure you &apos;re going to go on .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have maintained habits in the game .
so for the next world approach , we &apos;ve got a bigger , higher goal than just oil scarcity .
we &apos;ve developed the game called superstruct at the institute for the future .
the starting point is the calculation of a supercomputer , that people have only 23 years left on the planet .
this supercomputer is called , of course , the global emphasis sensitivity system .
we made a call to player , to sign up , we made almost like a &quot; jerry bruckheimer &quot; film .
you know jerry bruckheimer-films , where there &apos;s the dream-team , and you have the astronauts , the scientist , the exstraches , and only together you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say everyone &apos;s in the dream-team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played this game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when you google &quot; superstruct . &quot;
and the last game we get out on march three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get from the world bank the drawing &quot; social transformation age , &quot; gradually in 2010 .
we work with universities all over sub-saharan africa , and we invite them to learn social design .
we have a comic comic . we have &quot; level high &quot; for regional understanding , knowledge networks , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in developing areas that benefit from having their own social enterprises to save the world .
i &apos;m going to finish .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t rescued the real world yet .
well , i hope you &apos;ll agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , happiness productivity , the ability to make tight social networks , urgency optimism and desire for epic meaning .
i really hope that we play together major games to survive another century on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me and play with me .
when i look forward to the next decade , i &apos;m sure in two things : that we can create every imaginable future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something that came up with me a couple of months ago in writing an article for italian wired .
i always felt right when i was writing my synonym dictionary , but i was ready to work with the process of writing , and i realized that i &apos;ve never beaten up in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll read you the entry .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjective : &quot; warping , helpless , useless , destroyed , abandoned , mutilated , hurried , stored , stored , abandoned , checked , steamed , impotent , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful for faulted , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , faulted , wasteful , waired , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , faulted , wasteful , waired , wasteful , waired , waired , waired , waired , wasteful , waired , waired , waired , waired , waired , rubye , rubbery , rubye , rubye , wasteful , rubbered , ruby-bey , rubbered , rubbered , rubbered , rubye , ruby-beyed , rubye .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend of mine , and i first had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i just came to &quot; ratiated &quot; and i couldn &apos;t speak anymore , and i had to stop reading and start collecting for this sort of random shock .
of course , this was a balanced , old synonym dictionary , and i just thought that the issue must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy at the early &apos; 80s when i was starting to build and shape my own sense of self outside my family environment , and also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use synonym dictionary at the time .
if i took that revenue seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive me as a person whose life can &apos;t walk in a positive way , but today , i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the chances and adventures that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately called up the online copy of 2009 , expecting me to come up with a speaker &apos;s contribution here .
here &apos;s the updated version of this talk .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words are shooting me under &quot; near antonyms &quot; utterly &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , have really believed that the language of an escape has a big force , because what you say is that it can manifest itself .
so , what do we actually want to manifest -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
if you were to describe a person mindlessly as a child alone , you could extend them and overcome beliefs .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open the doors ?
a human who opened doors to me was my pediatrician at the a.i. dupont institute in wilmington in delaware .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo . a italo american , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly , so he was always called dr. p.
and dr. p. always had very colored flies , and it was just like to work with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my physiotherapy .
i had to use single practice , seemingly , infinitely , repeat with these thick , elastic bars -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles , and i hated these tails more than anything else . i hated them .
and imagine i &apos;ve even negotiated as a five-year-old child with dr. p. , trying to stop these exercise , natural without success .
and one day , he watched me in one of my practices -- these lessons were just tired and gratified -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful girl , you &apos;re going to be riding one day one of those stocks .
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was , of course , just a simple trick from dr. p. , so i &apos;m going to make the lessons i didn &apos;t want to do with the richest five-year-olds in the second floor , but he actually made me see my daily training horror with new eyes .
and i &apos;m now wondering how much his vision of me was shaped as a strong and powerful young girl to see my self-image and so i could imagine myself as a nature of strong , powerful and breathic person .
this is just one example of many , as adults in power positions can encourage the imagination of a child .
but just like the quoted examples from synonym dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine what we all wish : to allow each individual to see itself as a powerful human being .
our language indicates the social changes that have been triggered in many cases by a technology change .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visually impaired disabilities , cranks of titan and artificial hip joints for aging bodies that really allow people to use their ability to guide their own backwards and move their natural biases in the world .
so maybe this technology change indicates this technology change , because the ever that there was a different truth , which is that every human being can actually do something special and very powerful , and that the human capacity to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how i deal with skills , and i &apos;ll confess you something : that sentence for me never missed , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with answering the questions of people , and i believe , i am .
this set of doctrines with vitability lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on master a challenge without being coined by that connected experience , as though my life would have been so successful , because i could perceive the possible accidental of a prosthetic life , or as i could perceive as well as i could perceive as disabilities as disabilities as well .
but the truth is that we are changing . of course , we are shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
and expertise is not obstacle that we need to have a curve to deal with our lives better .
and expertise is just belonging to our lives .
and i tend to see expertise as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s barely to see , but it &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact , or deposit the severe of the fight of a human being .
there are commitments and challenges in life , and they are just all-to-real and every person is doing it differently , but the question is not whether we &apos;ve come along with counts or not , but how we deal with it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for preserving the people that we love with fatalities , but we prepare to prepare them for getting good with it .
and we don &apos;t like our children to make them feel like they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be amputated to one of the medical fact , and to another , the social opinion of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and pervasive disability i &apos;ve had to talk to each other is that the world is constantly meant to describe me with these definitions .
in our wish to protect the people who are at our heart and to give them the cold , hard truth about their health projections , or even providing a prediction to the quality of life that she expects , we have to adjust that we don &apos;t actually make the baseline for someone to be disabled .
maybe the current concept , which is just paying attention to what &apos;s in a broken , and how we repair it , for every single one of these more disabilities than the pathology itself .
if we don &apos;t treat a person wholly , and not perceive all of its forces and possibilities , in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to have to have , another disease .
we &apos;re degrading a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the patology and focus on all the realms of human possibilities .
but most importantly , there &apos;s a connection between the perception of our misery and our great inventor mind .
we should not devalue these challenging times , we should not deny them , we should not try to avoid them , nor should we turn them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing odds in the drivers .
i think it &apos;s a little bit more to make sense that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome vities , but that we are open to package them , package them on the shopf to use a fight expression , and maybe even danger with that .
and we might be able to see and feel that i think of it as something natural , coherent and useful , and just don &apos;t feel so troubled by your presence anymore .
this year we celebrate the 200 . birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , turned to something very real in the human character .
i would write it this way : not the most powerful of its species survives , and not the most intelligent of its way , but the one that can best adapt change .
conflict emerges creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of man , to survive and flourish , is defined by the fight of the human spirit , is to move through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest capabilities of human beings .
and we might only know what the wood we &apos;ve done when we &apos;re really tested .
maybe that &apos;s exactly what the sense of expertise , a sense of the iphone , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give expertise to a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see arguments as change .
and the chances are for a change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
honestly -- who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the common one . the typical one , but not the normal one , and would you really want to know this poor , gray person , if they really existed ?
i think , rather than that .
it would be great if we could actually formulate this paradigm of normality against other possibilities or strength to actually formulate it a little bit more dangerous , exchange it , so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to engage their special and valuable skills in society .
and what we found is that we humans have always asked people from the members of our society to be useful and to make a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that already the neanderthals have contributed around 60,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical injuries , and that might be happening because the life experience in the survival of these people was worthwhile for society .
they didn &apos;t think of these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i was growing up in the city that i grew up in a grocery market in this red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a castle tomato .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and i see this elderly man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know each other ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you might not remember me .
when i first saw her , i pulled her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it did click .
this was dr. kean , a man i knew only from storytelling from my mother that day , because i , of course , came too special to my birthday for two weeks .
my mother &apos;s pränatal diagnostic doctor was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born with no orbital legs , and my feet had guided after them , and i only had a few toes on this one and a few toes at the other foot , he was the overwhelming , this stranger had to murder the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as mobile as other children , or you could never live an independent life , and since they &apos;ve just punished me . &quot;
what i found was that he collected newspaper sections from my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won a letter competition in the second class , whether i &apos;d gone to the billboards at the parade &apos;s parade &apos;s school , no matter whether i could use my pennity or a grant from the leadvant school to help to teach the juvenivors to help from the bike school to help from the bike school for the juvenivores to help from my semidads in parade to help from the bike school , to help from the juliet in parade , to help of leakes to help from the bike school , to help , to help of leappointed leadola leadola leadolesivors to help , to help of the bike school , to help , to help , to help , to help , the seal school , to help from the seal school , to help from the juice , if i took the seal school , if i had gone to help , if i had gone to help from the juice , if i took a medical school , to help , and the juice , to help , to help , to help from the seal school .
and he called this part of his short x factor , the potential of human willingness .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough how powerful this factor can be for the quality of a human life .
and dr. kean continued to tell , he said , &quot; i learned that children , if they don &apos;t get anything else all the time , and even if they only get a little bit of support if you leave kids themselves , then children can do a lot . &quot;
you see , dr. kean changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnoses , and how someone could deal with it , are two different things .
and i &apos;ve also changed my thinking over the course of time , if you &apos;d asked me at the age of 15 , if i had traded my prosthetic legs out of meat and bone , i wouldn &apos;t have any second after that .
i really wanted to seem normal at the time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and this has happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite these experiences .
and maybe that change could happen too , because i &apos;ve encountered so many people who have opened to me doors , instead of encounter people who wanted to constrain me or wanted to overcome an idea .
you see , it really needs only one person demonstrating them how they can manifest their powers , and they &apos;re through .
if you enable someone to activate their own inner forces -- the human mind is so recommended -- if you can do that , and open a very important moment to somebody , you &apos;re a very good teacher for those people .
they teach them to open themselves doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; is rooted in the word &quot; educe . &quot;
it means to emphasize something in one is to tickle the potential out of it .
again , what potential do we want to recall ?
in the &apos; 60s , there was a case study done in britain , and at the time , gymnasia were transformed into overall schools .
they call this &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the united states , this is what we call &quot; tracking . &quot;
the students are divided up after grades .
and a student gets tired hard , gets the better teachers , etc .
they then wrote about a three-month period of time students with a &quot; enough &quot; the note &quot; very good . &quot; they were told that they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote in .
and of course , it breaks down to you the heart that reversely , the one-on-one students were told ; they were just sufficient .
and it was the same after the three months .
but only those of you who were still in high school -- apart from the students who had screened the school .
and the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not inserted .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that they were the one-ser-school students , and the students are sufficient with the note , and in the same way , they taught them something , and they were treating them .
the only real disability is a broken mind that has been broken , it has no more hope . it finds nothing more beautiful . it lacks our natural , child-curiosity , and our innate capacity of imagination .
but if we manage to support the human mind , to continue to hope for ourselves and other people around us , to find beautiful , curious and phantom , then we put our forces really positive .
if a spirit has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new modes of existence .
i want to end with a poem written by a persian poet called hafiz in the 14th century , and my friend jacques dembois told me that , &quot; the god who knows four words all the time . &quot; every child doesn &apos;t know the god doesn &apos;t know the name of god .
come with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose that by a few changes of your genes , i said that better memory could be -- more precise , more accurate and faster .
or do you want to be fitter , have more strength .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
what would it be like to live longer on good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those that have always been yearning for more creativity .
which one would you like the most ?
which one would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
put your hands up . let me see .
a couple . there are probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would make a decision for a good memory ?
a couple more .
what about fitness ?
a few fewer .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to think of that as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is that all education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a continuous topic here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor on the subject .
the great geneticists in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicator in the russian orthodox church , wrote an essay , &quot; nothing in biology does not make sense except in evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not accepting the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn your listening device , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can still take a look at kathryn schultz &apos; book .
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it good for others , or is it affecting us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve set up a bush as a center of branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all there are specifies on the tips of these branches in evolutionary concepts , they have survived it ; it has demonstrated its own fitness and strength .
the human part of this bug , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we are two stories from a common ancestor of modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this time period , maybe there were 20 or 25 different parts of hominids .
some people have come and gone .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
it seems that we are quite distinguished by the other parts of life , but actually the biggest part , are the fundamental mechanisms that are pretty equal to our cells .
do you realize that we can use that and take the mechanisms of a common bacterium to make the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetics ?
this is not like humaninsulin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemical distinctive of what comes out of the pancreas .
and what we &apos;re talking about bacteria is that every one of us in our gut will lead more bacteria than it takes cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , do you think , when antonio damasio asks her self-image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s firing , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that they just want to want without any effort on their side .
it &apos;s really a lighter way for bacteria , with occasionally unintended interruptions of unintended , forced jeodch to exit .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as important for their lives .
they help the digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in some kind of evolutionary balance in the form of a species ?
or are we likely to be something else -- something that might be actually better adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s step back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first indication of living creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago , on earth -- the first multi-cellular organisms , maybe as much as a billion years ago , and then as a billion years ago .
in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is only briefly measured in the earth ; the animal kingdom , like a single tap , and of the human life , a little notation .
that &apos;s us .
this also represents the entertainment of this talk , so i hope you enjoy it at d .
well , when i was a neuling on college , i had my first biologist classes .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very basic : in most of the existence of life in solitary organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is being kept on in both subtle cells .
but at the time , when multi-cellular organisms showed up , things started to change .
sexual reproduction comes into the image .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome continues , the rest of the body will repair .
in fact , what you might say is that the inevitability of the death of our body in evolution is the same moment that sexual reproduction happens .
now i have to confess when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death of sex -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but with every year , it has become my increasingly doubt .
i came to understand the feelings of george burns , who introduced his show in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat at the hotel door .
he opens the door .
there &apos;s a beautiful beautiful showgirl in front of him .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m for supersex here . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was working on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradicting , just in different ways .
i &apos;ve tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to recreate the health after a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the passing of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they and i are evolved by booster rockets to send the genetic fragrance to the next stage of orbit and then let themselves fall into the sea .
i think we would all understand the mood that woody made sense of what he said when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality by my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t inevitably prioritize the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest one .
evolution is prioritizing the creatures that will best adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean there are bacteria that are thermophil , and therefore the hot steam may survive otherwise if fish were there , it would be vacuum cooked fish , and yet they were able to make an inhabitable environment for themselves .
so , what that means is , if we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of human beings in evolution , and most of all , how do we look forward into the next stage , i would say that there &apos;s a range of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached some kind of a balance .
and the reason for that is that first of all , we &apos;ve done a lot of genes , we &apos;ve done a lot of things that would have been selected and have been removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species have configured us our environment in such a way that we &apos;ve managed to adapt it to us , and we adapt it to them .
and by the way , we migrate and circulation and we mix ourselves so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to take place .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be an evolution of traditional species , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be that the bikes of evolution are slowly electing , but they &apos;re uncomfortable .
and as far as isolation , if we colonize planets as a species , there will be isolation and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in a natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a locking , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but led and decided of us as an individual , in the decisions we make .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do that ?
let &apos;s start by looking at the reality that people today , in some cultures , make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are deciding .
so think , if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to incorporate genetic adaptations on the body , to cure and prevent the diseases .
what if you could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or eliminate the decline of cancer risk or stroke ?
would you not want to make these changes in your genes ?
if we look forward , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
the following year it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in the drone to four months .
today , you can complete a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a price of about 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to be the reality that there &apos;s going to be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it &apos;s going to be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering told the draper prize for francis arnold and wild stemmer , two scientists , who developed independently encouraged the natural process of evolution to work faster , and to have a desired proteins in a very efficient way -- that can make frances .
a few years ago , the laser prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research where he took a grown-ups , a fibroblasten , and by the manipulation of just four genes , the cell induced to lead to a pluripotent cell -- in a stem cell .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that the human insulin produces in bacteria can make viruses that are not only protecting itself , but also for immunity to other viruses .
believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study going on with vaccine for influenza that &apos;s been built in the cells of a tobacco plant .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
so imagine only two other small changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells from your descendants ?
what if you could change sperm and ice cells or fresh iranian egg to give your children a better chance for a healthier life -- eliminating diabetes , eliminating the hemophilie , reducing the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science that can enable the changes to prevent disease could also allow us to adopt goodbye super-attributes , hyper-capacity -- better memory .
why don &apos;t we have the crustulty of one ken jennings , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of watson &apos;s machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fibers that allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these will be inevitable .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to , we will be transformed by alt-style evolution to neo-evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that would typically require 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years -- and maybe even for the next 100 years .
these are decisions with which your grandchildren , or your grandchildren , are going to have to deal with .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , which is more popular , that &apos;s more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others of us ?
are we going to form dielangular and uniformer society , or robuster and diverse ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
and the deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
as good as in evil , and sooner than you might think , these decisions will be about us .
thank you .
now , i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you human capabilities , or another one that helps to stand up and go back and forth again . &amp; lt ; em &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
in berkeley bionics , we call these robots exoskeletons .
they &apos;re not anything but anything you put in the morning that gives you extra strength , which will increase your velocity further , and will help you maintain your balance for example .
this is , in fact , the true melting of human and machine .
but not only that -- merging with it and connecting with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on the backs on its back , and it &apos;s the question that they &apos;re supposed to have more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- injuries , 30 percent of them -- chronic injuries .
so we thought that we were going to take this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help us deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now to hulc -- or the human universal load carrier .
soldat : with the hulc-exoskeleton , i can carry 200 pounds of different terrain , for many hours .
his flexible design enables you to stand deep , to war and execute highly wasteful movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then elevates my strength and persistence .
we are so far with our industrial partner to imagine this device , this new exoskeleton skeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take a look at the wheelchair drivers , something i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people sitting in the wheelchair around the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we often talk about very young people with spinal cord injury , who have been hit by the height of their life -- 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s -- by destiny , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number is multiplied .
and pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a stroke , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , since he said , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
now let me introduce you to elegangs , which is carried by amanda boxtel , who suffered a spinal cord injury 19 years ago , which had the result that it couldn &apos;t run since 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda contributes our elegs .
it has sensors .
his completely non-invasive sensors in the crutches , sending signals back to our onboard-computer , which is attached here on her back .
here are also batty-packaging , the engine drive is on their hip , as well as their cup joints , which are moving forward in this very smooth and very natural gangbee .
i was 24 years old , and i was in the best form , when a mundane purplish tree was paralyzed during a skill ride .
in the fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement under my cover .
not long after that , a doctor went to my clinic room , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he steel every fifth hope from my consciousness .
adaptive technologies have since then been able to learn to ski again , to climb and even ride with my hands .
but nothing was invented to let me leave until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the entire potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the wheelchair drivers , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of development division of a non-profit called robin hood .
if i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting a firefight for a fireman &apos;s chief with a volunteer lift on fire .
well , in our city , in which volunteer supported a highly skilled workforce service , you have to be pretty early in the branding site to be mixed .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the center , so i was pretty good chances to be able to get in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the accountable headman and to figure out what our jobs would be .
when i found the main man , he had just in a very serious entertainment with the householder who had , surely one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the pairs and barefoot under a screen outside in the rains of rain as her house was in flames .
the other volunteer who had arrived in front of me -- let &apos;s call him lex luther -- got to the main man first , and i was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the householder .
the dog ! i was badly pre-neid .
there was some lawyer or furniture administrator , who was now for the rest of his life that could tell people that he was walking into a burning house to save a living thing only because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the main man shut me up .
he said , &quot; look , you &apos;ve got to go to the house .
you have to go up , by the fire , and you have to get some shoes for this woman . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i was hoping for , but i went out -- the stairs up , the floods , over to the &quot; real &quot; firemen , who had done quite finished at that point with the limb , in order to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was my prey back to the bottom , where i met my enemy on the door , and i met the beloved dog .
we took our estimates from outside to home , where , not surprisingly , he was given a lot more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the firewaks received a letter from the home owner where they thanked for the brakes for the rescue of their household .
one about all appreciated kindness : somebody had even brought her a pair of shoes .
both in my profession with robin hood and my next job as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m witnessing generosity and kindness on the large-scale , but i also see the welfare love and the muts of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look around this room and see people who have either been able to achieve an adjacent success or are there on their way , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in somebody else &apos;s life until you &apos;ve accomplished your first million .
if you have something to give , you &apos;re going to give it now .
they serve in a food kitchen , they &apos;re tidying up a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we will offer an opportunity to save the lives of a human being , but every day we have a chance to change one .
so put them on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community who knows the secret to the continuity of humanity .
a place where women take the prescription , say , &quot; hello , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not burning you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relative .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the forests of congo .
bonobos , along with chimpanzees , are our closest living relative .
that means we have a common ancestry , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve overstated this aspect of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of medal
while chimpanzees are run by large , terrifying candles , the bonoboo society is led by empowered females .
they really came up with this , because this leads to an exquisite tolerant society where deadly violence has not been observed for so far .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known among primates .
they live in the depths of the congolese urwhale , and the observation is very difficult to observe .
the congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the array of a violent argument that &apos;s been devastated for decades and almost as many lives have required as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that this destruction also endangered the survival of the bonobos .
meat trade and the decline of the cotton gives you that you couldn &apos;t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and even we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden gene sweeping the trees .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love rather than war &quot; monkeys , because they have accessible , bisexual sex , with interacting partners , and rules such as conflict and social angels .
i &apos;m not saying that this is the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the life of the bonobos is made up of more than cama sutra .
bonobos -- like humans -- love playing their lives for a long time .
play doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
for us and she is a game profoundly for connectedness of relationships and the care of tolerance .
and this is how we trust and the rules of the game .
play stops creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about generating diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity in connection .
and when you watch bonobos playing , you see the evolutionary origins of human laughs , dance and rituals .
game is the tickle that holds us together .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique footage right now from the wild .
first , a ball game on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think about football .
so here &apos;s a young female and a male playing in a tracking game .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
that could be the evolutionary origin of saying , &quot; she &apos;s packing it with the eggs . &quot;
i think it &apos;s more like it , i don &apos;t think it .
yeah .
so sex games are prevalent , both bonobos and in humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea that you get new elements in the game -- like the testicles -- and how the game requires both trust and fits -- while it is at the same time impressive fun .
but the game is a shape-transducer .
play is a shape-transducer , and it can take lots of shapes that some of which are quiet , phantom , curious -- maybe to rediscover the astonishing thing .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays with water peaceful .
and i think just like they do sometimes play alone , and we pail boundaries of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this kind of playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected wires that we form are the real nutrients of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insights that bonobos give us to our past and present .
but they also preserve a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to growing challenges , through greater creativity and pressure .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adaptability joker .
in order to successfully adapt to an unfinished world , we have to play .
but will we do the best from our play drive ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and humans , equally , life is not made up of teeth and claws alone .
just if it doesn &apos;t seem to be appropriate , maybe play is the most necessary .
and so my primate companions , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together , while rediscover the creativity of companion and the wonder and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs in the mid-1979 , the very same day , at the same time , each of which is a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each of them is a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imagining this , because if you think about the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , the sperm is holding a y chomosom that meets the x chromosome of the egg cell .
and in the other case , the sperm contributes a x chromosome that meets the x chromosome of the egg cell .
both are enabler , both of them are sin .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
for most of my activities , i have two hips .
i &apos;m involved in the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m a student of historian , and in this case , i study how people moved with anatomy -- that is , human body , animal body -- as they went with body fluids , with body concepts , how they thought about bodies .
the other hat i &apos;ve carried in my work is the activist , the patient lawyer -- or , as i sometimes say , as an impatient lawyer -- of people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have body types challenging social norms .
so for example , i worked with people who are siamesian twins , two people in a body .
i was working with people who were working with caches -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i worked with interpersonal people whose gender is atypical -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female bodies types .
and as a general term , we can use this word of intersexuality .
intersexuality is happening in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a couple of examples of the kinds of sexual variants that don &apos;t disagree with the male or female standard .
in a case , you might have someone with a xy chromosome base , and the sry gene of the y chomosoms will keep the protogonads that we all have fatal stadium to grow up to high .
and that &apos;s why the testes are abandoning the fetal stadium testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and this is called androgenreceptor defect .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to that .
as a consequence , the body is developing more typically female during the end .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s usually until she reaches the puberty and her breasts grow and evolve , but she doesn &apos;t get her periodic until somebody comes to it that &apos;s a little bit different .
and they do a couple of tests , and they find out that instead of sticks and uterus , they actually have testicles in it , and that it has an y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually think of this person as a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called adrenalinglands in our body .
they are in the rear part of our body .
and the side levels are androgenes , which are virilizing hormones .
most of the women , like me -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosome , but i think i probably have the typical woman -- most women like me are actually speaking on androgens .
we produce androgen and we respond to androgens .
and the consequence is that somebody like me actually had a brain that was more androgenous than a woman who was born with testicles and has a receptor defect of androgen-receptor defect .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexuals are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , they can be distributed across the entire bandwidth .
here &apos;s another example : a few years ago i received a call from a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , a boy , had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just figured out that he had a butt and a uterminor .
he had an extreme form of an innate side cattle .
he &apos;s got xx chromosome , and in the womb , his side has been so highly active that they &apos;ve basically created a male hormone environment .
and as a consequence , his genitaly was male , his brain was exposed to the typical male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one saw anything .
and it wasn &apos;t until he turned 19 , he got enough medical problems , actually because he inherently touched , that the doctors found out that he was a female inside .
okay , just one quick example of a varied of intersexuality .
some people with xx chromosomes , are developing something called ovotestis , where ovarian tissues are covered in high-dentissues .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different variants .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it grew or siamesian twins , whether it &apos;s intersexual -- surgeons often adjusted to the norm is not because that &apos;s the health of their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often threaten different types of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that there is a certain anatomic exploitation with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is supposed to have a woman &apos;s identity ; to be a black person , is supposed to have an african anatomy in terms of their own history .
so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually represents something very different for us , it confuses us in terms of these categories .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism in our culture .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , who are two people in a body .
where i &apos;d experienced most of my exciting lately was the south african runner in caster semenya last year whose gender was asked in the leichatlethics of world championship in berlin .
a lot of journalists would call me the question : &quot; which test are you going to make , which tells us whether caster semenya is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journalists that there is no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature , for us , is not a line between male and female , or between male and intersexually and female and intersexe , we think it &apos;s what we say is that dividing line , of course , than we do .
so we have a situation where , the further our science continues , we have to come up with more that those categories that we &apos;ve held for stable anatomic categories , which made very simple adjustments to create permanent identity disorders than we can have accomplished much more than we can .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also true in terms of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our terminology has allowed .
in our view , we got all kinds of inconvenient areas .
for example , we shoot for the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re not going to distinguish ourselves from them by a few nucleotides ?
as we move forward our science further and further , we are increasingly coming into a zone of the discomfort , where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that we &apos;ve probably had to be too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different forms of human life .
one of the areas in which we see this in the beipiel , in our culture today , in today &apos;s united states , is the struggle over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what point a body becomes human , so that it &apos;s a different right than the fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations nowadays -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- the question of when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never had that hard to fight with the question when someone was dead .
they just kept a spring under their nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if it didn &apos;t move anymore , you buried it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we take people &apos;s vital organs and we want to plant other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re starting to deal with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we used to .
now you might think that the whole collapse of categories somebody really would make me happy .
i &apos;m progressive , i defend people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , i &apos;m nervous .
understanding that these categories are actually much more insecure than we thought makes me excited .
and it makes me feel accepted in terms of consideration of democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i first have to know that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were racisite , i know they were sexy , but they were great .
i think they were so brave and so radically , and so radically , in what they did , i began to look at the malignant musical music in 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 1776 with the founding fathers .
the founding fathers in my view were the initial anatomical activists , and that &apos;s why .
what they replied was an anatomical concept , and they put it in a different one that was radically and beautiful , and 200 years were consistent for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers rejected the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplified concept of anatomy .
the rulers of the old world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of birth on the right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were given the notion that people who had political power should have this political power , because of the inherited bloodline from grandfather to son and so on .
the founding fathers returned this idea , and they replaced it through a new anatomical concept , and this concept said that all humans were created in the same way .
they were kidding the playing field , and they decided that anatomically , the commonalities counted , not the differences . and that was very radical .
now they did that part because they were part of an enlightening system where two things grew together .
democracy grew heran , but at the same time the science grew in .
if you look at the history of founding fathers , many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of the natural world .
they went away from declarations of supernatural species , and proven things like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very utilitarian concepts of birth .
they moved to a natural concept .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they made us a concept that was of anatomical commonalities .
and so in a really wonderful way , you prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after that ?
for example , women who deployed the voting right , the concept of founding fathers saying that anatomic commonality is more important than the anatomic difference , and said , &quot; we should have a full-up citizen and eighty as a difference , we should not have the right to election .
and women made the case successfully .
the next one was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like soviner truth , who spach , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the marginers of the citizen movement who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people have different skin color that occur to anatomic commonalities from anatomical differences , again , successfully .
we see the same thing with the disabled law movement .
of course , the problem is that as well as we start to look at all the similarities , we have to begin to ask in question why we maintain certain separations .
now , well-meaning , i want to sustain certain slides , anatomically speaking , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you a fish the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take off anatomy from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-olds should have the right to give their insight to sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomical separations that make sense to me , and that we , i think , should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out which it is and why we keep it , and whether it &apos;s meaningful .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures who have been verified at the beginning of the talk .
we &apos;ve seen two creatures , both in the mid-1979 , exactly the same day .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , who was born three months old , so she &apos;s born on the 1 june 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , is born to the birthday min , so he &apos;s born on march one march in 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria was born for three months , she gains all sorts of rights three months before heinrich -- having the right to have the right to choose the right to drink the right .
heinrich has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the time point of his birth .
we still find other features about what their rights are .
heinrich , because you assume that it &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you it &apos;s the one with xy -- because you assume that it &apos;s male , it can now be moved in , which maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , not in all states , can perceive the same right that has heinrich in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can today only maria can marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these permanent anatomic categories that are problematic and questionable in many ways .
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is making such progress in the realm of anatomy that we have to make a point where we have to admit that a democracy that could occur on anatomy could fall apart ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it feels like the science is self-perpetuating itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; good , we have to move a line somewhere , so we &apos;re going to move it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , at a point , decided to marry a man means you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and to marry a woman means you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you at the beginning of the androgenic receptor defect .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of &quot; kind of a solution .
he says we should not be judging people by &quot; their skin color , but by the property of their character , &quot; and go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people because of their characteristics ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in a way of people , because i have to admit that i have to know a number of golden retriever that probably make socials more likely than some people i know .
i want to say that i probably know some bright label dogs that are more powerful , more intelligent , more rich decisions about your sexual relations than some 40-year-olds i know .
so how are we going to do the question for the characteristics of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me wondered , what if the content of a personality is something that could be done in the future of machine readable -- by the fmri ?
do we really want to go this way ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i know is that it really seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is at making ideas about democracy questions .
in our endeavor of democracy , we &apos;ve done our stuff really well , and i think we &apos;re going to do our things in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran is the case where a man who feels sexually to other men , is punished with death , unless he &apos;s ready to sign a gender transformation in which case can stay alive .
states of these species don &apos;t exist with us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i talked to a few years ago that had brought a few siamesian twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was with him , and i asked him why he was doing these interventions -- it was highly risked surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these children would be very poor , and so he had to do it .
i answered him , &quot; now have you drawn political asyl instead of having surgery to separate you ? &quot;
the united states has incredible opportunities for allowing people to be the ones they are , without needing to change around the state .
that &apos;s why i think we have to be leading .
all right , just to conclude , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the dads .
and i want to think about the possibility of what democracy might look like , or if we had more involved in mothers .
and i want to say something that &apos;s a little bit radical for feminist , and i think there might be different kinds of insights that dominate different types of anatomy , especially if people have a group thinking .
for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in intersexuality , i &apos;ve also been interested in gender research research research .
and one of the things that i really thought was interesting is the difference between men and women in a way that they think and interact in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from a cross-cultural study is that women , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- tend to have complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable in the group to give a lot of attention .
and that &apos;s why , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
years ago , when i went to graduate school , one of my graduate students asked me to do my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , i &apos;m doing it -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what is feminism female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about dissolving stereotypes about gender , so feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there could be something female in feminism .
that is to say , there could be something on the average of what female brains are different from male brains that make us more interested in complex social relationships and to pay attention to the protected need .
so where the founding fathers were extremely suspicious to figure out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we could get more concept , not just how to protect each other , but how to care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future , when we do democracy across anatomy -- less think about the individual body in terms of identity , thinking more about relationships .
so that if we try to make a volk a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to do a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to every opportunity to find a different colorful , insane outfit , to carry , and also to photograph and blogging in the last time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of secondary hand on flower markets and second-hand-hand-shops .
ooh , thank you .
second-hand shopping allows me to reduce the influence of my garderobe to the environment , and also to my wallet .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars are used to serve for a good purpose ; i look pretty unique , and it makes a shopping for my very personal aspiracy .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all of the answers are yes , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i &apos;ve put up here for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does anybody carry with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve brought to you .
i brought with seven underpants , and that &apos;s all .
subpants for just a week are all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i cried that i was going to find everything else i might want to wear , if i first came to palm springs .
and since you have not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s walking around here at ted in her underwear -- that means i &apos;ve found a couple of things .
and i would like to show you my outfits for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i believe or not , from those adventures , i &apos;ve learned not to carry anything new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the bright tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , has cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece i &apos;ve carried all this week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is completely overrated .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , and to adapt at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to also appreciate it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people tell me i looked like i &apos;m playing dresses , or i remember her seven-year-olds .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good in something , it &apos;s almost secure .
and if you think that you don &apos;t look good in something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but first of all , when i turned 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you briefly .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and out there &apos;s a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can carry .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden paila adapt to everything .
and ultimately , saturday : a single , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
it was proven to me over and over and over this week , when people came up to me just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate it all again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn from myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to have this stuff emotionally , because right around the corner , there will always be another crazy , colorful , radiant outfit that just waiting for me if i have a little bit of love in the heart and search for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody together .
i have something i want to show you here .
think of this as an image , as a fly image .
this is what we call perceptual design in our lab .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows up with this image in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is the formula 1 in the past decade something interesting happened .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula 1 race , you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then they won the race .
now today , if you want to win a race , you actually need something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors that have information from the car , that information continues to the system , and then you use them to restore and change that car in real time .
this would be called , in engineering teams , a real-time controls system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made up of two parts -- a sensing part and a responsive array .
what &apos;s interesting now is real-time control systems begin to appear in our lives .
our cities , over the last few years , have been modeled with networks and electronics .
they become computers in the free .
and when computers are free , they start reacting in a different way , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
if we &apos;re building cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
beyond the cities , all of this is pulling into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition called the paola antonelli for moma later in the year , working during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , are starting to speak back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like each atom is going to be out there , a sensor and a driver .
and that radically changes the interaction that we have people out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as michelangelo shaped the moses , it means he took him at the end of the hammer and threw him on moses -- in fact , you can still see a little bit down -- and said , &quot; peré non parli ? why don &apos;t you make it ? &quot;
well , today , for the first time , our environment begins to respond to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you a couple of examples -- again , looking at the idea of embracing and pushing our environment .
let &apos;s start with perceiving .
now the first project i want to introduce to you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it was formed four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we did was actually use a new kind of network that was used around the world -- it &apos;s a mobile phone network -- and anonymous and aggregated information from this network that &apos;s been collected by the operator to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was when italy won the soccer world championship .
some of you will remember it was when italy played against france , and then at the end of zidane , the head of it .
and anyway , italy won at the end .
now look at what happened that day , just observing the activity that &apos;s happening in the network .
here you see the city .
you can see in the middle the colosseum , the flooding tiber .
in the morning , in front of the game .
you see the timeline on the top .
in the early afternoon , people here and there , doing calls and moving .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a tor . italy makes a gateway .
half-time people make a short call , go to toilet .
second half-time . end of the normal game time .
first extension , second extension .
zidane , at a moment of the head .
italy wins . yeah .
now that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big impact .
the next day , they all went to the center to meet the seventh team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everyone went down .
you see the image of the space about co massimo , where , since the tube time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the impact at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
just a different example of this : this is not about people , it &apos;s about things that we use and consume .
well , today we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that make up a mac computer , how they came together .
but we only know a little bit about where things go .
so in this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the trash while it &apos;s going through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who helped us , a little over a year ago , in seattle , to highlight the things that they threw -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would throw away .
and then we have the little chips , the little brands that are glued on the trash and started tracking it .
here &apos;s the results we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there are lots of inefficient incentives in the system .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is what happens to a lot of unuseful things , and complicated things .
but the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day , the cup we throw away , we don &apos;t just disappear that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle , which we &apos;re still throwing away every day .
and if we show that to people , then we can do a behavior change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you a lot more about that and the many other wonderful things that you can perceive , but i want to talk to the second part that we discuss in the beginning , and that &apos;s the acceptance of our environment .
and the first project is something we did a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
it started with a question of the mayor who came to us and said that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition to use in public areas as part of architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were put in a workforce was , imagine this tubes , and valves , magnetic valves , that are opening and closing .
they &apos;re creating something like a water curtain with data points from water .
if these visuals fall down , you can write about it , you can show patterns , images , text .
and you can come back to him , and it will open up to make you jump through , as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of belhole .
he really enjoyed him .
and we got the mission to design a building in the process of the expo .
we called it the digital water pavillion .
the whole building was water .
there are no doors or windows , but when it approaches it , it will open and it will open and it .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can actually put the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture , like this case , you know , these days when you go down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there saying , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , you didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s happening inside .
and here you see me as i was trying to get the most sensors opening the water , not getting wet .
well , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
but it was actually a even bigger fun that night .
all the children from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make them open , but a building that had still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without a mess .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use the things that we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are being used and interacting with the people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical visual points , the images of water and the projects on it .
and this is what got us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine those images could really start to fly .
imagine you could have a little helicopter flying through the air , and each of you with a little framework with changing light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you saw earlier , moving with others , completely synchronized .
you can have the cloud .
you can have some kind of flexible screen or display like this -- a uniquely formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , but in three dimensions , where what changes , the light is not the position of the points .
they can play with different ways .
imagine before the screen could just appear in different formats or sizes in different kinds of resolution .
but then all of this could be just a 3d cloud of images that you can go through , and that you can go through , that you can look at from many , many directions .
here you can see a real flyficate controller reducing herself to form an equal form like before .
when you turn on the lights , it looks like this . so , just like we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of the people is being driven .
it could be every single point of impulse that comes from people , from people &apos;s movements or whatever .
i want to just show you one thing here .
we worked with roberto bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the étoile on the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala in mailand -- we took his movements in 3d to use them as a pulse for the flyfire .
this is roberto dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the data points , the different signs of early impressions .
it &apos;s a real-time 3d scan and a motion recording .
so they can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the data points , you can play with it and play with color motion and motion .
this is what we want to use as a potential impulse to the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
again , the idea is , imagine that we refer to the people with something and to change the environment -- almost as we call it to build the cloud movement of how to move a scheunor , but with a cloud .
imagine that everyone can give a little spider for an image .
i think that the remarkable thing about the last couple of years that we &apos;ve done over the last decade is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and makes it available through the internet .
today , for the first time -- and the campaign of obamas has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , of which self-organizing forces of networks to the physical world .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , to ask us the challenges that are coming -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to the physical world ?
so the idea is that we actually include people with each other , doing things together , collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud of images , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of images .
it &apos;s a physical diagram in london , but it &apos;s covered with data points .
they can move inside and have different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , share the most important moments for the olympia 2012 and the one , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physics cloud in the sky and something at the top you can walk , like london &apos;s new mines .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital globe in the night -- but most important , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the context is very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
for the first time , i was almost 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first iceberg .
i started awe .
my heart hit , and i was faithful as i was trying to figure out what was in front of me .
the icebergs raped around me almost 60 meters out of the water , and i was able to only wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake year after year .
icebergs are born as a limestone of a glacier , or breaking out of ice colles .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting in a very clearly with their environment and their experience .
some refuses to give up and worms to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t stand it anymore and collapse dramatic passion in a case .
if you look at a iceberg , you can think that they &apos;re isolated , separated and separated , just like we humans tend to see us .
but the truth is far from it .
as an iceberg melts , i breathe its precipitate atmosphere .
during the iceberg , it &apos;s melting out mineral drinking water , feeding a lot of life forms .
i think in my footage of these icebergs , as if i were to make portraits of my ancestors , in the consciousness that they have existed in these individual moments of this way , and they will never exist again .
it &apos;s not a death when they melt ; it &apos;s not the end ; it &apos;s a progression of their pathway along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the icebery that i &apos;m photographic is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you are a iceberg that i &apos;ve photographed in kekertsuatsiak in greenland .
very rarely you will actually witness a rolling iceberg .
here you can see it now .
on the left side , you see a little boat .
this is about five meters long .
please pay attention to the form of the iceberg , and where it is in the water line .
you can see here , it &apos;s beginning to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man &apos;s standing there .
that &apos;s the average size of a greenland iceberg .
it rains about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like this , the iceberg shows you a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary at work on some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on is this guy .
his name is tempt .
tempt was one of the leading graffiti artists of the &apos; 80s .
then , one day , he came back and said , &quot; paps , my legs tied . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of it .
tempt today is utterly paralyzed .
he can only use his eyes .
i was facing him .
so i have a company that does design and animations , graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire and watch in the art world .
so we decided to support tony -- tempt -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back to him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all communicate the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about the higher society layer and you &apos;ve got a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how does you communicate it ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &quot; butterling and divergent bell &quot; ?
so they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers walk along .
i staunted , &quot; very archaic , how could that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to just put a check , and instead i made a check that i didn &apos;t have the easy idea of how to resolve it .
i commit to his brother and father , in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;ll get him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s carrying all this , can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface of any surface and then to draw with a laser pointer on it that just governs the negative area .
so they move around and they do art installations like this .
they &apos;re saying that all things that are shown up there follow a life cycle .
and it starts with gender , and then the email words come , after the bush crimes , and the bush publishing and the last thing people do is actually making art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home and ate with my wife too evening and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second time there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , we should find a way to steer a laser would be so graffiti again .
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve done some things .
first of all , we &apos;ve injected the doors , and we &apos;ve actually got a device for tempt to actually get a device that can communicate with -- a stephen hawking machine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so unworthy , this guy is incredible . &quot;
moreover , we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- back home at us .
my wife , my kids and i moved to the garage , and these hacker and programmers and conspiracy theorist and archists have taken our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that , and that we &apos;d come back and all the images on the walls would be free .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to the street in venice , my children were engaged , and my dog was also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sunglasses that we bought at the shoreline of venice , a little bit copper and some of the stuff from the construction market and the electronics trade .
we took a ps3-camera , we diverged it , we put it on a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s freely available -- you can build it yourself , we &apos;re providing the code for free , the software can be downloaded .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of constraints .
no insurance can combine .
neither was a hospital .
each paralyzed can actually communicate or draw with his eyes alone .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to speed &apos;s room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s a room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all this rummula before the great unveiling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , nuclear parties and searched , tony drew back after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond its life support system .
we got his bed so that he can see out there .
we put a projector on a wall of the parking board in front of the hospital .
and he drew for the first time in both of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense that was in the parking lot .
so , luciously we had to break into the parking lot , so we felt rightly as part of the wiring scene .
in the end , he sent us an email with this content , &quot; for the first time in seven years , i &apos;ve been drawn something .
i feel that i was depressed underwater , and i finally got somebody going down and raised my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our fight .
that &apos;s what keeps us in the constant , and it &apos;s continuing to let us evolve .
and we still have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but there &apos;s a spell in the same way .
and someone who has such an artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve received all kinds of recognition .
we &apos;ve won a few awards .
think about it , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve about it .
it all comes from our own pockets .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twittered about us , and then , in december , we honored the time-magazine as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really nice .
the coolest thing about this is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that there &apos;s this april , when moca was interior city of los angeles , there will be an exhibition called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and there may be pretty much the toughest representatives of the street art scene -- banksy , shed fairey , caws -- all these guys will be there .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty much down .
so basically , i &apos;m talking about this : when you see something that &apos;s impossible , it can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible sometime .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with augenerative technology , but i &apos;ve just achieved something , and i &apos;ve surrounded myself with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs together .
and this question should each of you ask each and every single day where you have to be asked something that needs to be done . if not , then , when ? and if not me , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most promiseful child author .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come along with a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever chosen farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere .
you go to the block and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends made it -- richard bollingbroke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;d like to tell you about today .
my circle began back in the &apos; 60s at high school in stow , ohio , where i was the classroom .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the virgin green and blue until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by making me use the toilet in the classroom .
she did secretly .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of town .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it swallowed me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and at the time in the &apos; 80s , i found it important to do a work on aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of the night from this teacher , woman posts , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned about each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come with the guy i know you &apos;ve found it in between now .
and i should say that i have pancreatic cancer , and i want you to be please yearns . &quot;
well the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took them around , and we took care of their family eight , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn to know me as an adult , met me , turned them into a box full of ashes and was put into my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation that i talked about .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved yours .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that takes the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad this has been mentioned so often today .
it needs the same -- it would take love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as you go up to 1,000 meters .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a power plant , the bag , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , blah , blah , clack .
that sounds frightening .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1d .
i was the only one who could talk to the airline companion .
so i looked at them in a second , and they said , &quot; no problem , we might have caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already turned the machine , and we were not that far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set out the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s not the route usually .
it turns off the powers .
i want you to imagine a noisy airplane .
and then he said three words -- the lowest words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; ready for the impact . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordpersonal anymore .
i could see it in her eyes there was scared that life was at the end .
now i want to share three things that i &apos;ve learned about me this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this plan of life , we have these things that we want to make in life , and i thought about all the people that i wanted to reach out and not do it , all the fences that i wanted to flick , all the experiences that i wanted to do and never made .
while i was thinking about it later , i was struck by a saying , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is so far and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to move any more in life .
and that urgency , that goal , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day -- and that was , when we missed the george washington bridge , pretty much about hair latitude -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really appreciate .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i aspired to be better in everything i grabbed .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
and i took the time that i wasted for meaningless things , hatea , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to banish negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t compensate with my wife for two years anymore .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to be right anymore ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- while the body is beginning , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , count down . &quot;
you can see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , as you know from documentations .
as we fall down , i had this feeling , human being , to die is not terrifying .
it &apos;s almost as if we prepare our lives for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really formed in an idea that i only wished one thing .
i just wish i could see my children growing up .
about a month later , i visited a performance of my daughter -- first graders , not much artistic talent .
don &apos;t yet .
and i celebrate , i &apos;m wine like a little kid .
and everything made sense to me in the world .
i realized at the time , by connecting the dots to each other , that life is all about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life , to be a good father .
i became a miracle part of not dying that day .
i received another gift , which is to see the future and come back and live differently .
my call to all of you who are flying today is , imagine that the same is happening on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would you do that you put up because you think you were there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for nuclear weapons development is the uran-incentive facility in natance .
the gray boxes that you see here are real-time controls .
now if we can compact the systems that are competing , control numbers and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , an effective windows virus , can be incorporated on a laptop that &apos;s used by a waiting engineer to configurate this gray box , then we &apos;re in the business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind stuxnet .
so we start with a windows dropper .
the user data is transferred into the gray box , damaged the centrifuge and the iranian nuclear power program -- it &apos;s yielding .
this is a child game , right ?
i want to tell you how we found this .
when we started our research at stuxnet six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the purpose and purpose of this construction .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated about the windows part , the dropper-per-part , did of numerous shattered op surveillance .
and it seemed to be preferring with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet , and we studied this construct .
and then something funny happened .
and stuxnet had a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- sniffled off , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my mind .
and after experimenting with different types of cheese , it occurred to me that this is a targeted attack .
entirely targeted to a particular target .
the dropper is activated on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even when the special program that is trying to infect on this goal .
and if it &apos;s not , there &apos;s nothing going to do .
so that really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could , for example , be an american power plant , or it could be a chemical plant in germany .
so we better find out what the goal is .
so extracted , and we deformed the attack code , and we found that it &apos;s restructured in two digital warheads -- smaller a one and a larger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professional constructed by people who had , obviously , all insider information .
they knew all kinds of bits and bytes that they had to attack .
they probably knew the size of the machine operator .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the dropper of stuxnet complex and high-tech is , let me tell you , the user data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s an excerpt from this attack code .
we &apos;re talking about here -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks like old-fashioned assembly language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart from this code .
so after the first thing that we did , we were system-functioning , because we know what these things are going to work . &amp; lt ; em &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and then we were looking for brainstorms and data structures and trying to connect them with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories of these goals that we could demonstrate or resistant to .
to put these theories up , we call ourselves remembering that it &apos;s definitely high-level sabotage , and it &apos;s got to be a high-quality goal , and it &apos;s likely to be in iran because most of the infections were reported there .
well , there are not many thousands of goals in this area .
it &apos;s basically running out of the primarily nuclear power plant and the incentives in natance .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for centrifuge and power works from our customer tribe . &quot;
and i called them up and i tapped their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible for us to connect the little digital head with the torture controller .
the rotor is this moving part inside the centrifuge , this black object you see .
and when you manipulate the speed of this rotors , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor and eventually let the centrifuge explode .
and what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually to let it happen slowly and inquently -- obviously in the attempt engineers to be branching , so they wouldn &apos;t be able to get there quickly .
the great digital head -- we got a glimpse , looking at very precisely data and data structures .
so , for example , number 164 sticks out of this code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .
i began to work through scientific literature about how this centrifuge was built in natance , and found that they &apos;re structured in what we call the cascaskades , and each cascade contains 164 centrifuels .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it got better .
these centrifuges in iran have been split up into 15 so-called flat .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
it &apos;s a almost identical structure .
so again , the fit was really good together .
and this gave us a great confidence for what we &apos;re looking at here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go like this .
these results have been achieved through several weeks of hard work .
and often we just ran into a dead end , and we had to recollect ourselves .
anyway , what we found is that both digital warheads actually headed into one and the same goal , but out of different directions .
the little head takes over a cascade , and it flips the rotors and it slows them down , and the big head starts with six cascades in interaction and manipulate ventilates .
so , by and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have defined what the goal is .
it &apos;s natance , and it &apos;s only nearby .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets are going to be stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- actually blocked me out of the socks .
down there is the gray box , and on the top , you see the centrifuge .
now , what this thing does is it starts the shareholding values of sensors -- so , for example , by printing sensors and vibrational sensors -- and it provides legitimate code that &apos;s still available during the attack , with false data .
and in fact , this false input data from stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where , during the tracking chase , the surveillance camera is fed with video recording earlier .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea of this is obviously not just to list the machine operators in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to transfer a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine operator can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , if the large steam turbine gets too fast , you have to open outrage valves within a milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
so at this point we need digital security systems .
and if they &apos;re at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the machine leaders , nor the security system will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is general .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with centrifuge , with copyright makeup .
so , for example , he would work as well -- in a power station or in a automobile factory .
it &apos;s generalistic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to get the user data on a usb stick , as we &apos;ve seen at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
and if you do that , you end up getting a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals like this is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most targeted environments .
we have to put the consequences on the consequences , and we &apos;re going to start to prepare for ourselves better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported a lot of it , that people suspect that mossad is the main organization behind it .
is that yours ?
okay , you really want to know this ?
yeah . okay .
i think mossad is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the cyber superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- luckily , luckily .
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for chasing us a sanitary fear . thank you ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years placing myself in situations that normally are very difficult , and at the same time , are kind of dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a coal mining work -- dangerous .
i filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing here -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i was actually exposed to the greatest part of my career in terrible situations , and it &apos;s all for trying to study social belonging in such a way that they &apos;re compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way of understanding what makes you entertainment and accessible to the audience .
so when i knew i was going to come here , in a tedtalk , to look at the world of branding and sponsoring , i knew i was going to do something a little different .
some of you may have heard that i did an ad on ebay a couple of weeks ago .
i sent out some facebook news , some twitter news messages , and i gave people the opportunity to get the namensright on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , for-profit and non-profits , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let that ever again -- buy the namensright on the talk that you just saw , who didn &apos;t have a title or a lot of content on it .
so what you got was this : your name here presents : my tedtalk , which you have no idea what the topic is going to be , and that could fly you for any content at all around your ears , especially when i bring your company to your participation dumm .
but besides that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people watch these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the workforce , by the way .
so despite that warning , i knew that anybody was going to buy namecraft .
now if you had asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with certainty .
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
and as i said , over the years i &apos;ve been putting myself in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could get me prepared , nothing could get me to do anything that was as difficult and as dangerous as this guy in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is make a film around product placement , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from above to bottom , from the beginning to the end , is completely familiar with brands -- from the theme sponsor you &apos;ll see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x.
now this brand , the qualcomm stadium , the stage center ...
these people will be connected to the film in eternity forever -- forever .
and so the movie is going to study this whole idea -- this is what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that was more to emphasize .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x as the front sponsor , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so maybe we &apos;ll sell a shoe , and it &apos;ll be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever driven from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold &quot; the greatest fears you &apos;ve ever had , a mindset of &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing you that brands are part of life , actually , to get you to fund the movie ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole movie is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing going on in the movie of the stats .
so this is the whole concept , the whole movie , from beginning to end .
and i &apos;d be happy if ceg was going to help make this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know what people are going to be reciprocal .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; vantage , &quot; because that &apos;s got a negative connotation -- but you know how this is going to evolve ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth noticing some really familiar brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a horde vollidiots .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is probably going to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a tough thing about the movie or a hard thing about me ?
jk : both .
so ... meaning , not that optimistic .
so my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we have to think about the brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people that you have to do with ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
take the camera out .
i thought , &quot; put the camera out &quot; would mean we wanted to have a backup conversation .
it turns out that it actually meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with their film . &quot;
and just so all these companies disappeared , one by one .
i didn &apos;t want to have something to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept was , the idea of advertising , presenting your product as many people as possible , let it see as many people as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , at this intersection of new media and the fragmented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting medication instrument that the masses is making that message .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was this .
actually , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this image stands for is a problem .
you see , if you put transparency in the google search , that &apos;s -- this is one of the first pictures that comes out .
i really like your species , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- freely of deception and door , just to explore and go through , instantly , characterized by visibility and access to information , especially what matters in terms of business -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to the point that it &apos;s supposed to be implemented , something is changing .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this strange bear , still screaming .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
it &apos;s a very cool whip of food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me lying -- and there he sits , and he looks at this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions in every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there was only one company , an agency , ready to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i know john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to handle the middle man and walk with my team .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to realize -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood is a comprehensive problem .
i have friends who make big , gigantic hollywood movies , and i have friends who make little independent films like i do .
and my friends who make big , gigantic hollywood movies , say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of branding partners they have .
and then my friends who make little independent movies , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , gigantic hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie sold . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
whenever i go there , and every time i open the medical cabinet , you &apos;ll see deodorant .
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you so far ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should put a little bit of this in front of the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of those great dunes .
either &quot; floral fusion , &quot; or &quot; paradise winds , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men and for women -- solid , roll-on , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the short census .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you an extraordinary census .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve been talking about the smaller films , we are a challenge as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so making things like this -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
in which words would you describe ban ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a great question .
legendary technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that somebody &apos;s doing under the chutes .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes into something positive , as opposed to &quot; fight smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million-company .
what about me ? what about pressure ittypes ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , which is like me , otto normal consumers .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clothes .
woman : &apos; 80s revival hits scaterpunk , except on a weak day .
all right , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
unique .
i think the rearsal , the style i have , i think , is &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like lots of black colors , lots of gray sounds and stuff like that .
but i usually have an accessory , like sunglasses , or a jewelry and stuff .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classical mercedes cabrio .
man 2 : the brand i am , i would say , lousy fly .
girl 2 : partly hippie , part yogi , part brooklyn-girl -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum guy .
i sell marks all over the country , around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i were more trained .
man 5 : brand rooted alcohol addicted writer berling .
is that ?
anwalt : i &apos;m a lawyer stamp .
i &apos;m tom .
now , we can &apos;t all be the tom-brand , but i often look at the interface of dark glamour and good fly .
and what i noticed was that i needed to have a experts .
i needed somebody who could invade my head , someone who could really help me understand what it is called branding personality .
and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg .
they &apos;ve helped companies like nestle , fever , hallmark , to discover this personality .
if you could do it for those , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures along , yes ?
this is me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how this is connected to your thoughts and feelings about her own .
these are the people who form my view of the world .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think your own world is the world where you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live , the work and the way you live .
all of these things came and start from a place , and for me they come and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is this in the context of thinking and feeling about it yourself ?
it &apos;s the way i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like odd things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does she bring us ?
what is the machete ? what puppet stadium you are at the moment ?
why is it important to start ? what does the red represent ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
which other metamorphosis have you running through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be scared . what kind of rollercoaster do you have ?
eeee ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to get out of it .
there were lots of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that your brand personalized ecti had two separate but herediting pages -- the morgan spurlock-brand is an eighth / negotiated brand .
they do very well .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength instead of both .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- avoiding things you &apos;re not sure , you will avoid fear , those elements , and you will welcome those , and you will actually turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a little tracker .
what other brands are acting like this ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , target , wii , mini , mini coopers and jetblue .
well , there &apos;s brands and eighth brands , these things that come and go , but one you played , eighty brand is a pretty strong thing .
an eighth , played brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
if someone asked them to describe their signature identity , their branding personality , what would they be ?
you an up-attribut ? are you something that brings blood into walls ?
or are they more like a down-attribute ?
are you something that is a little quietly quiet , reservative , conservative ?
up-attributes are things that are around , fresh like the fresh prince , timely , adventurous , falling out and lovely like erflynn , agile and agile , magical , mystic , like gandalf .
or are they more like a down-attribute ?
are they mindful and moons like 007 ?
are they established , traditionally , nursing , protective , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , family , surely , born , holy , imagined the way the dalai lama or yoda ?
in the course of the movie , we had over 500 companies that were up and down companies and said , &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this movie , because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but it was 17 brand partners willing to be able to get this control that wanted to do business with somebody so dear and play , and eventually enabled us to tell stories that we wouldn &apos;t usually have told -- stories that a commercial would never be supported .
they made us tell the story of neuromarketing , the way we tell the story in this movie , that you use mris today to pile the lustcenters of the brain to make both advertising and films .
we went to sao paulo , where we had been banned in outdoors .
throughout the city for five years , there &apos;s no proposal afel , no posters , no flyer , nothing .
and we drove in school districts where companies have their way into impoverished schools , across america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got the most feedback from , or where i had the greatest success , are the ones where i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
because they went around the middle-man , and they surrounded the agencies , and they said , maybe the agencies don &apos;t really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think that our world is challenging .
and what was that for you ? what is it successful ?
now , since the film with the sundance film festival had premiere , we can take a look at that .
according to burrelle , the premiere in january , and since then -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this movie .
it &apos;s actually just a two-thirds period of time .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not delivered yet .
there &apos;s not even been online . there &apos;s no training .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
now , the film has gained a very big momentum .
and this is not bad for a project where almost every ad agency we spoke with , has recommended their customers to make their fingers stay .
what i believe is that if you take the chance of taking risks , taking risks in these risks .
i think if you stop people from that , then you get them closer to failure .
i believe that if you train your employees to take risks , you prepare the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people not to be scared of opportunities that maybe scared them .
after all , in progressing , we should welcome the fear .
we should have the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
we &apos;re willing to take a huge spoon full of it , so we &apos;ll welcome the risk .
and finally , let &apos;s welcome transparency .
nowadays , more than ever , a little bit of honesty takes us very far .
and that &apos;s what i said , with honesty and transparency , my overall talk , they welcome transparency , was presented by my good friends of emc who paid $ 7100 for namebay dollars .
big data is transformed to organizations around the world in big opportunities .
emc : &quot; welcome transparency
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what has happened right with the $ 7100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i spent a check in my pocket , on the top organization of the ted organization , the sapling foundation -- a check at $ 7100 to fund my ted performance in the next year .
my name is amit .
i was doing something else about google 18 months ago , and i was talking about doing something with museums and art . my chefin , which is now , gave me a green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on performance .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i &apos;m not complaining -- but i had too many museums , and i didn &apos;t have access to these works of art .
and when i was traveling , and i started to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i was trying to make this desire -- to make art more accessible -- to bring technology together .
we then created a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i think i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the start .
so you just go to googleartproject.com.
you can walk around here in all these museums .
there &apos;s the uffizi , the moma , the hermitage , the rijks , van gogh .
i even come to one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
click and wumms , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you have fun .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open up the map , and jump with a click .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the gang .
just keep on . lots of fun .
hide them .
thank you , but the best one is still coming .
so now i am in front of one of my favorite images , serious carriage by beeter breugel in the met .
i see this plussign .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click this out now .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve been stuck with what we call the gigapixel-technology .
for example , this image has about 10 billion points , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you this now .
you can zoom in very easily and you can .
you see a funny thing here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized there was something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
and i got close to it , and i slowly noticed that these kids actually did a little bit .
i did some research , i talked to some familiar met , and actually it turns out that it &apos;s a game called squail , where a gans is beaten on the fast tuesday with a stick .
it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to get really close to that , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the overview , i &apos;m zooming out so you can see what you get .
here we are , and this is the painting .
the best part is still -- in a second .
let &apos;s go quickly to moma , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
for the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the paintbrush strikes ?
and what if you want to see van gogh created this masterpiece ?
you zoomed in . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in to one of my favorite elements of this picture until i &apos;m really in the rides .
this is star night , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
every one of you , everybody -- whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- out of all of these pictures , you can go into your own collection .
just , you go in -- and i created this , which means the power of zoom -- you can zoom around .
that &apos;s the healthy ones , the national monumental .
you can miss everything with assumptions , send your friends , and such a conversation begin to think about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , to me , is the main thing that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come here from google .
i mean , they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience of humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;ll be just talking to this digital medium of art and represent them online properly .
and the biggest question i &apos;m going to ask recently is , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a museum council ? &quot;
the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s supposed to arrange the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided in two halves .
that &apos;s the left half that &apos;s the logical side , and then the right half that &apos;s the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the aptitute of every hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , this is somebody who is completely logical .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
now , where would you positioning your brain at this scale ?
some of us may have decided to have chosen for one of these extremes , but i think , for most people in the audience , their brain looks something like this -- with a high aptitute that is in both hemispheres at the same time .
it &apos;s not as though they &apos;re both exclusive or whatever .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists who need a good share of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of intuition to actually execute the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it , and then we look at how it responds , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that this thing can only be in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can be odd to think about , that one thing is at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed it .
i remember watching a kid playing on a floor threshold .
he was a little kid , and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he was falling all the time .
but i bet that playing with the floor threshold taught a very valuable lesson , which is that the great things don &apos;t just leave you by , and that they stay in a place .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as you &apos;re not a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they &apos;re not playing with bodives pig , but they &apos;re playing with these little weirdos particles .
and if you play with your particles , you find all kinds of weird things -- how you fly directly through walls , or that at the same time you can be in two different places .
and so they wrote all of these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; it took quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but it didn &apos;t take them to describe the big everyday objects around us .
it didn &apos;t like my intuition , and it might just because i don &apos;t play with particles so often .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one has ever seen one particles .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
because if all things are made of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , shouldn &apos;t they just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be like that .
so i would feel better with the whole thing , if we could sort of show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so a couple of years ago , i was doing exactly that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quantum mechanical superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;ll talk about in a moment .
this is a picture of the object .
here i &apos;ll give it a little bit . we &apos;ll just look at the center right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal that &apos;s shaped like a springboard , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i made this thing similar to making a computer chip .
i went a clean room with new silicium slices , racking for 100 hours to all the great devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a swimming pool hole and the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in quantum mechanical superposition , but it takes a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things but then other people go up , and i stop doing all these things , because i don &apos;t want to make them comfortable , or frankly , they &apos;re missing them .
so quantum mechanics says unmovable objects are in the same way .
the passenger for subtle objects is not only humans , but also the light that seems to them and the wind that fails to you and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal acts to quantum mechanical , we had to kick all the coarieties out .
and then we did that .
we turned off the lights , put it in a vacuum and suck up all the air , and we used to kiss it up almost to the present , all alone on the elevator , was the piece of metal , as usual , to behave .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it &apos;s really weird .
instead of just being quiet there , it was fourth . the way it was fourth was sort of like this -- like an extension and elderly bladder bubble .
in which we gave him a little push , we could vibrate it at the same time and not vibrating -- something that is only allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what &apos;s really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate and not vibrating for an object at the same time ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms that make the piece of metal is still there , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .
just to precise newspapers , they agree .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re delocalized .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which at the same time means that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me singing for all this year in the clean room , because , you know , you check this , the massable difference between a single atom and that piece of metal is kind of like the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time in two different places , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why can &apos;t you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine if you were in multiple places at the same time , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness realize that your body is occurring in the space ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we warmed it up , the lights turned on and looked at the box in , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all of the objects in the elevator are really just aggressive objects that are collected in a small space .
you hear a lot of just about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s deeper than that .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should recognize how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , they will give them an opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition for new inhabitants .
at the moment , we &apos;re far from that destination .
there are billions of people in the developing world who are not even given a single city that would welcome them .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs them to build .
so we could take the world very easily with stupid , perhaps even hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , as far as you &apos;ve never thought of new cities .
so they &apos;re just trading out the building of apartments against the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in apartments doing this already ; the other half of them don &apos;t yet .
you could try to expand the capacity of the already existing apartments .
but you know what they were going to incorporate in these apartments and their environments to dominate law to avoid being complained and deflected from building .
so it turns out to be very difficult to replicate all of these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a completely new block of housing , providing the laws there would support this construction and not stop it .
so i suggested that governments are creating new areas that offer enough space to a city , and i gave them a name : charter cities .
i found out later that , about the same time , jafour and octavio , about the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 hondurans left their land to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in honduras .
at this point , jafour said to octavio , &quot; what happens if we take a blank area of our country -- what if we just give them a message -- some of the american embassy -- a part of the canadian bottlenecks and then when people want to go to the u.s.
in the summer of 2009 , honduras was suffering from a major representation crisis .
in the next plantless elections , pepe lobo won in an envelope whose program promised both new , as well as screaming .
he asked octavio to become his steady .
in the meantime , i was preparing a talk at tedglobal .
by improving , trial and examining consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of charter city to basically reduce elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you cannot even have existing housing owners .
we give new technologies great consideration , but for the progress , it needs technologies and laws . and it &apos;s usually laws that hold us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala octavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
and this again showed him jafour .
the two called me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to us the chairman of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december in the sember room of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make it clear about how valuable cities are to how much more valuable they are than they are at the cost of it .
and i &apos;ve used this chart to show how valuable rohland is in a place like new york , and remember that there &apos;s an area in some cases a square meter of thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , we might be looking at tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk , in a very simple form , represented that a charter city is a place where it is initially uninhabited land , a mapping assignment that determines the laws that exist there and the people have the opportunity to decide either to live under those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant that we have to make this project important , and that this is the way we &apos;re going to move our country forward .
i was asked to go to tegucigpa and give a talk on the fourth and fifth of january .
so i &apos;ve given one more filled talk , which involves a graph like this , which is trying to demonstrate that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city denver , and the sketch shows the new airport that was built in denver .
that airport alone has a hundred square kilometers .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the hondurans , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 square miles .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
for sure , all of them have applaud .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and very carefully .
the director of the congress came up on the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you so much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have it on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the point that a new city offers new possibilities to people .
there would be a way to live in a city that would be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also enters new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in honduras would be dependent on the aid of partnership countries , they could benefit from their partnership countries that would actually help them promote the laws for this charter and in seduction that everybody can trust that charter could really be done .
and the insight of president lobo was that the assessment i thought of as a way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city considerably relevant for all of those parties in honduras that have been under fear and deals .
we went to an area .
this picture is from this place .
it looks like a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , on the 19th of january , they voted to congress for a constitution of the constitution to have a facial rule that &apos;s allowed for specific development areas .
in a country that has just been striking crisis behind it , congress was elected for this change in 124 to a voice .
all parties , all the fractions of society , supported this .
and to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on february 17th , it was approved the second time with 114 to a voice .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and the 24th of february , there was a delegation of about 30 famers in the world that were most interested in climbing into the business of the urban tebout .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new city-censorship built in south korea -- large-scale urban bostons .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to maintain the permits .
the other place that was very interested in building cities is singapore .
there have been two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a building site , and they &apos;re already talking about this area for the second town .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that managers are allowed to participate , and it &apos;s also working on a more external rights system .
a country has already offered to provide its supreme court as a dish for the comprehensive calling of the legal system .
and also urban designers and construction are very interested .
they actually bring money into it .
one thing , as you already know , has been pointed out , there are lots of landlords .
there &apos;s a lot of operations that would like to colonize in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s a lot of people who would like to live there .
there are 700 million people around the world who say they want to live permanently in another place .
a million people leave every year latin america and migrant to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to give back their families to go to work -- sometimes there are single mothers who have to make enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even children trying to find their parents , who they , in some cases , have never seen their parents for a decade .
so what is it for an idea of thinking about this in honduras , building a whole new city ?
or even duceding of building these cities , or distributing hundreds around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition for new inhabitants ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i did a poll recently with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that makes anxiety a typical american on a day is 70.
and also , a recent study that was done with ceos , where they watched the ceos for a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different topics that this ceo has been working on , and how much time they make decisions with the things that come together with the issues .
and what they found is that the average ceo is working on 139 tasks a week .
each of those topics , of course , consisted many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions have been made in nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions took them an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes you &apos;re faced with the one hour in category ?
how good do you think are you making decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the great decision-making problems of our modern time , the decision-making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise you because i &apos;m blind , just hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you willing to hear about decision-making disposal problems ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive grocery store , at least at the time , he was really exclusive .
it was a store called the draeger .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure savings .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and essig and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables , and more than two dozen different types of water -- and that was at a time when we actually drowned light water .
i loved going to the store ; but at a time i was wondering , well , how did you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil going .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were embedded in boxes that came from thousands of years of old olive trees .
so i decided to go to the filialleiter one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he pointed to the bus charges of tourists , who &apos;d come every day and used to have their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
here &apos;s your collecting gang .
they had 348 different types of marmelade .
we set up a little coincidence directly at the entrance of business .
we &apos;ve put six different flavors of margin , or 24 different flavors of margin , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first of all , i &apos;d be able to stay more people and try melade ?
there are more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent , than when they were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what was the case people were buying a glass of mold .
now we saw the reverse effect .
of the people who stayed when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of marmelade .
of the people who stayed when they were six , well , we now saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mold .
now , if you do the math , people bought six times more like a glass of margin , who they had six to select than if they had 24 times the selection .
now , to decide not to buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waistness -- but it turns out that decision-making discharge problems also affects us in very consequence decisions .
we &apos;re not deciding to decide , even though it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so the issue of the day : financial savings .
now i &apos;m going to describe a study i &apos;m going to do with gur huberman , emir kamenica , wei jang , where we &apos;re setting up decisions for the retirement of nearly a million americans in about 650 plans all over the united states .
and what we &apos;ve been looking at is whether the number of fund offers that were a retirement plan could be 401 plan that influenced the likelihood of saving more tomorrow .
and what we found was that there was a context in fact .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that offered people something between two to 59 different fonds .
and what we found was that the more fonds were offered , that , in fact , the participation was lower .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that provides two fonds had a participatory rate in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans that offered nearly 60 fonds , the participants now fell in about the sixth percentage .
now it turns out that even if they &apos;ve been disconnected , if there are more possibilities for choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate will be more likely to have the more possibilities they have available , the more they rent it into actia and fonds .
the more opportunities they had , the more they had , the more they put their entire money in the purchasing market .
not one of those extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that someone would recommend when they &apos;re going to have their future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that offer more and more choices with them .
they shut up the choice -- shoot , even when it comes to their own best interest .
they tend to make worse decisions -- poorer financial and worse medical decisions .
they tend to decide for things that they make themselves less satisfied , even if they make it objective better .
and the main reason for this is that maybe we enjoy looking at these huge shelves of mayonaise , mustard , essively and municipal , but we can &apos;t actually draw the comparisons and separations and then actually choose something from the fabulous offering .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and in different places of research -- that you can just use in your business .
first of all , limited .
you heard it before , but it was never more truer than it is today that less is more .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; limited . &quot;
you &apos;re always worried that you &apos;re losing real area .
but in fact , we see more and more , and more , that if you &apos;re willing to constrainate and unimportant equal opportunities are going to be off , well , then there &apos;s an increase in the sales , and there &apos;s a cost to be saved , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a change in decision-making perception .
as proctor and gamble decreased the different head and shoulder species from 26 to 15 , they experienced a 10 percent increase in sales .
when the golden cat corporation got rid of her 10 at the worst selling catzenus , she experienced that the revenue was taken by 87 percent -- a result of both of the sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average supermacrt today offers 45,000 products .
a typical walmart offers 100,000 products today .
but the nine-largest supermarket today , which is now the most beautiful supermarket in the world , is aldi , and they only offer you 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that recently came out of the market is how do you best pay for choice , something that david laibson has made a lot of money , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
every single harvard now automatically takes part of a life fund .
those who really want to make a choice will be offered 20 fonds , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to lower it .
they &apos;re all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i asked the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t distinguish them apart , their customers can &apos;t . &quot;
now , before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be ready to offer all of the people in this audience a single including paying for the vacation of the world &apos;s most beautiful street .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read them to you .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read you , and then i &apos;ll ask you to clap you , if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s offer .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s offer .
is that everybody ?
well , let me show you a little bit more of it .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
all right .
the fact is that you saw objectively , the first time they had more information than the second time , but i would expect to guess that they felt more real at the second time .
because the pictures lifted it for them to feel real .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of decision-making , which is the concretization .
it &apos;s about people trying to understand the difference between capabilities , having to understand what the consequences are associated with the individual choices , and that these consequences have to be felt vidly and concrete .
why do people spend about 15 to 30 percent more if they use an ec-map or a credit card than on barmoney ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel the money .
and it turns out that if you do it , something feels concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to make people save more .
so we &apos;ve done in a study i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we &apos;ve done a study with the people at ing -- employees who &apos;ve all worked for ing -- and these people were all in a collection where they &apos;ve done their participation for their savings .
and during this assembly , we &apos;ve inflicted this convention just as it used to be , we &apos;ve just added a little bit of it .
the smallness that we added was that we asked people to just think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives , if they were to save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or pay an increase by four percent by the amount they were ready to pay for savings accounts .
the third technology : categorization .
we can better deal with more categories than with more choices .
so here &apos;s , for example , a study that we did in a process of magazine .
it turns out it &apos;s in the thromans supermarkets up and down in the northeast , the number between 31 different kinds of magazines has up to 64 magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and divide them into 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and put them in 20 categories , i believe i &apos;ve given you more choice and a better choice than i would have given you the 400 over the time i &apos;ve given you the 600 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different dirty facilities .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; swing . &quot;
if you think the left ad is swing , and the ad on the right is jazz , you clap it in your hands .
okay , there are a few .
if you think that &apos;s on the left side of jazz and that , on the right side of swing , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
this is a highly non-useful category .
the categories have to tell the selection something , not the one that provides the choice .
and this is a problem that you often see when you look at the long lists of all of these fonds .
who do you really want to inform ?
my fourth technology : enforcement for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we just have to simplify it .
we have to slowly increase complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german manufacturer who gives you the possibility of configuting your car completely on its own .
you have to make 62 different decisions to make your car completely .
now these decisions are different from the number of choices that you provide per choice .
autocolors , outcolors of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
now , what i do is i change the order in which the choices seem .
half of the customers are going to go from the many ways to 56 highs to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the clients go from the low options , four motors , to the 56 autocolors , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interested they are .
if you use the standard choice all the time in the decision , that means you &apos;re overwhelmed , the hottest , i lose it .
what they &apos;re finding is that the people who go from the many to the low possible choices and keep choosing the standard choice all the time .
we lose them .
you go from the little choices to the many , and then you stay there .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is it &apos;s to change the order in which this information is present .
when i start with the simple instructions , i &apos;m learning how to choose .
even though the gear is selected , there &apos;s nothing to tell me about my remains in interior equipment , it &apos;s still preparing me to select .
it also gives me an excitement about the great product that i come together , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be motivated with interest .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that are narrowing the problem of decision-making -- narrow the over-fluid alternative ; concrete it -- make it real , categorized -- we can better deal with more categories , fewer possibilities ; in complexity .
each of these techniques i describe to you today is meant to help you manage the possibilities for you -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , for the people that you have service .
because i think the key to the possible choice is that you &apos;re selective in the selection .
and the more we select , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , steends-manager at youtube , and i &apos;m looking at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are viral , and then finally , why that &apos;s important at all .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so hard to do .
but web videos have allowed us all , or all of our creative activities , we can become insanely famous in a part of the world &apos;s culture .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded every minute .
again , only a tiny percentage ever gets viral and is viewed thousands of times and so on for the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , participant communities and the unexpected .
well , then we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
ohhhh , wowwww !
last year , bear vasquez sended this video that he shot in front of his house in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it had been looked 23 million times .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video became popular for the first time last summer .
actually , bear did not want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share one rainbow .
because you just do that , if you &apos;re called yosemite mountain .
he had uploaded lots of natural videos .
and this video had actually been sent back in january .
what happened here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmel would send the tweet , who ended up making the video so popular .
because tastemaker like jimmy kimmel shows us new and interesting things , and show a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . &apos; everybody &apos;s vision to the weekend . friday . friday . friday , friday . &apos; at down friday . her friday didn &apos;t think we were going to have that conversation without talking about this video .
rebecca blacks &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been looked at almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like the double rainbow , it seems to be out of nowhere .
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know it , those other peaks are also a little bit of fridays .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
well , tosh.0 said it , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson from the mystery science theater was a first person to make a joke with twitter .
what &apos;s important is that a single person or group of tastemakers took a standpoint , shared with a large audience and began to accelerate the process .
and then this community of people who shared this big joke , and started talking about it and playing around with it .
now there are 10,000 parodies of friday at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single day .
unlike the 20th century one-sided entertainment , the participation of the community is to become our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making something new out of it .
nyan cat is animation and music in loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it &apos;s been looked at almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-hour version of it that &apos;s been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
what &apos;s important is the creativity that &apos;s in the internet culture of technology and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody did an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix community laid out of the ground that made it from a silly joke that we can all participate in .
today , we &apos;re not just finding enjoyment on something we &apos;re doing with .
who could have done all of this ?
who could have predicted &quot; the double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; nyan cat ? &quot;
what are the dreaming books that you can write that &apos;s in ?
in a world where every minute of two days of video is uploaded , only really unique and unexpected emerges emerge as the video i mentioned .
i admit i wasn &apos;t interested in myself when a friend said i should be looking at this great video about a guy protesting in new york against the ticket for bicycles in bicycles .
i got a ticket because i didn &apos;t go to the bike path , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t let you drive on the bike path .
because that was completely surprising and humorous , casey niestats became a funny idea and looked at his argument five million times .
this approach applies to anything new , which we do creatively .
and all of this leads to the one big question ...
what does that mean ?
ohhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative communities , utterly unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to , and in which the audience is celebrating popularity .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber , made his start at youtube .
no one has to give a green light to your ideas .
and today we all feel ourselves as the owner of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re also hardly hitting the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the interconnectedness between women about three generations , and how the astonishing strength of this interconnectedness confronted in a four-year girl &apos;s life , and her little sister , and her grandmother , five days and nipped together in a little boat .
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
i want to tell you about some of the pieces of the puzzle .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose entire life was held together by the simple hope of oneness and freedom of his home .
if you think of it as the lump of the communicators in saigon , as he must conceive that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , were betting his own .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgotten me his life .
i had to make sure it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was going through trying to crush us , but we were over it .
the next piece of the puzzle shows how a boat is running out in the early morning red on sea .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranted marriage , with two little girls .
for them , their lives had set up a task : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was totally excluded that it could fail .
after a four-year and filmmaking saga , a boat was silent at the sea as a fishing boat .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear was pirate , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little pot bottle .
when i was a prisoner , my sister and i , you know , you and my grandmother had drunk on it .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady tumors of the engine , the clapping of any wave on the bug , the length and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirate that came many times , but fed up by the death courage of men on our boat , or the fall of the motors who didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform off the malayan coast , and on the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the trip was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple rock that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple has ever looked like this again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we ended up in melbourne .
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women in three generations who have a new life together .
we went to footscray nieder , one of the working-class suburbia , whose population consists of immigrant layers .
unlike the old-class suburbs , whose existence was completely unknown to me , footscray did not have a demanding thought .
the framework from the shrimp came from the rest of the world .
and the fatalities broken english were traded between people who had one thing in common : they started again .
my mother worked on farms , then on a assembly line in a car factory , six days , double layers .
and they kind of managed to find the time to adapt english and it-qualifications .
we were poor .
every dollar was divided and was put in another education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for it , and most of the time , the new things that always came out of secondary hand .
two strands for school each one to cover the holes in the other .
it &apos;s a school uniform to the sideways , because it had to do six years .
and there were the rare but painful choirs of &quot; bad eye , &quot; and here and there &apos;s change appointments : &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
go home ?
there was something going on inside of me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to take you out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we were telling each other about our day , and we were listening to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from the boat &apos;s nightmare .
and it was my assignment to stay awake every night until their nightmares came to let me turn them up .
she opened up a computer shop , and then did a cosmetic training and opened up a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t make change , angry and inflexible children , and arrested children , trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were searched .
centers were built up .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one of them , i was the classic asian student , the immensely demanding demands of self .
in the other hand , i was involved in uncertain life , wearing the tragic scars of violence , the drug abuse and the isolation .
but that &apos;s how many people got the help over the years .
and because of that help , i was announced in my last year of law school as a young australian of the year .
and i was catapulted by a piece of puzzle to the next , and i didn &apos;t fit the edges .
tan le , anonymous actors of footscray , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak of places she &apos;d never heard of , and in housing whose existence had never been imagined .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the etiquette .
i didn &apos;t know how to use that steck .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the convenience of the life of an unknown preorate -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who have been shut down every day for 20 years by telling each other the stories of their day and sleeping , we still slept three in the same bed .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was now as old as you then had climbed the boat .
no has never been an opportunity .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about adolescence and education , and neglect of marginalized and discalculated .
and the more i speak , the more i should tell .
i met people in all of their lives , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the boundaries of the possible .
and even though i graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t go out on a career in jura .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a new leader , new in the image -- and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boots .
because there can be so easily guided to collapse of the horizons , so light that you can embrace the assumptions of the environment .
now i &apos;ve come enough from my comfort area to know that , yes , the world is breaking apart , but not the way you fear it .
options that wouldn &apos;t have been allowed were highly encouraged .
there was a energy , an unfavorable optimism , an odd mixture of humility and wagnity .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a small team of people around me who didn &apos;t convey a shoe challenge for the shoe blade .
we didn &apos;t have a dime for a year .
at the end of a day , i cooked a huge top soup that we shared .
we worked until the night .
most of our ideas were mad , but it was a few brilliant people , and we got the breakthrough .
i made a decision to move to the united states .
after just a trip there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure continued to go .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time in the confucianism , the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries .
her father died soon after her birth .
her mother put her on her own .
by 17 , she became the second woman of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
without support of her husband , she was worried about a sensation by putting him in trial and claim in her own case , and a stronger conversation than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t get &quot; it turned out to be untrue .
i was shooting in a hotel room in sydney , when she died . 1,000 kilometers outside in melbourne .
i looked through the slippery wall , and i saw them standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me for a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in footscray and we sat around her sarg .
we told her stories and made sure that we were still with her .
and at midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the sarg .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding them this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going to be run by the women .
you see who we were , and how life shapes us , we can now see that the men that might have come to our lives would have come to us .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i &apos;m thinking about the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yes , i &apos;m scared of privilege , of abundance , in adversarification .
can i give you a bug in your life that &apos;s courageous to every wave , the unrooted , steady tumors of the engine , the horizontally that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and i could make it secure , i would do it .
and also , tans &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or five series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it even photography ?
because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography when i received my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
i combined it with my previous excuse to draw , but it was a little bit different , because the camera used to be the process of planning so much .
and when you pick up a picture with a camera , the end of the process , when you press on the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed to be more about being in the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , which is where the process starts when the trigger is expressed .
photos like this : a construction site along a much riding road .
but it has an unexpected turn .
and yet a realistic level is maintaining .
or photos like this -- dark and colorful and colorful at the same time , but everyone with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean photo-reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really catch , but i always want to make it look like they can have that , in a photo .
photos for which you have to think for a moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not what &apos;s realistic about ; it &apos;s what we think is realistic .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects that we can all identify with in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , you can create something that still looks like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we &apos;re crossing our brains , because our brains just don &apos;t really feel like it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about that are the things around us in our lives .
but when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just kind of look wrong .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow to make a realistic outcome .
and as you can see , these are not three special images .
so you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photographs should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined photos should have the same types of lighting .
and these two pictures fulfill these two requirements -- shot out of the same altitude and the same types of lighting .
third , it &apos;s about not making it impossible to distinguish where the individuals start and end by connecting them seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
so by comparing color , contrast and longevity to the edges of individual images , photographic men , like felddepth , distinguishable colors and disorders , we wipe the boundaries between the different images and make them look like a single photo , although a hundred can basically contain hundreds .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape of landscape , and the bottom part has been manipulated .
but this is actually a picture that &apos;s completely put together in the face of photographs of different locations .
i personally find that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise with ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i needed for several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a glory flight .
the bank comes from a different place .
the underwater part comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even cleaned the house up on the island of red to make it look swedish .
so to get to a realistic outcome , it &apos;s from me looking out on planning .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
and after that , it &apos;s the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s every piece that &apos;s very well planned .
and if you take good pictures , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so there are all kinds of tools , and the only thing that limites us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects fail .
and i think the most important point about this is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced at the radboud university was to do a main listener .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or a cup of tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- maybe only most of the electronic health projects are wrong : because we &apos;ve stopped listening .
this is my wland waage . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button / off .
and every morning i jumped on it .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i set my job at 95 lbs .
it works very simply : every time i jump on the waage , it &apos;s sending my data on google health .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re called up by my general doctor , so that he can see where my weight problem is , and that &apos;s not just the moment that i need cardiological support or so , but also with a view of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
you might know that , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 followers on twitter .
so every morning i jump to my wool waage and people are already talking to me before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; for lunch , only a little salt today , lucia . &quot;
but this is the netest thing that can happen , because this is the group compulsion , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could reject patient &apos;s smoking .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play a game together to control their health .
every week , that &apos;s coming to market .
there will be this little blood pressure measurement device that you attach to an iphone or something .
and it &apos;s going to enable people to measure their blood pressure from home , send it to their doctor , sharing it with other people , for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come in , not only can they take control again , they can be capital on their own ship , but they can also help us deal with the challenges that are ahead of us , and the cost explosion of health care , doubled , and so on .
do the methods that are easy to use and start to hug patients with this team .
and they can do that by using these kinds of methods , but also crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is i want to share with you through a short video .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the atms are located around maastricht .
we still know one more where everybody is staying .
and sure , we can find fast foods .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
we &apos;ve asked around , and no one knew .
no one knew where to find the next life-saving aed at that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we set up a website , and we asked a crowd , &quot; if you see an aed , please share where it is , when it &apos;s up , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed during the business times , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds have already been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps to do this .
and we designed an ipad app .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , extended reality to find this aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht and someone breaks together , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks your microsoftware cell phone to find the next aed that can save your life .
and today , we want to use this not just as aed4u , which the product is called , but also as aed4us .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like nodes to crowdsource these aeds all over the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation and somebody collapses , whether it &apos;s your own relativity or someone else , you can find such an aed .
the other thing that we want to ask for is that companies around the world are helping us with the confirmation of this aeds .
these could be copious services , or technicians , for example , just to make sure that the melted aed is still in its place .
please help us and try to improve health not only , but take the hand out .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology sector .
and my little startup wants us to protect ourselves in the environment by ...
... it &apos;s the crowdsourcing consideration .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh . a moment .
it might take me until it &apos;s loaded .
now -- we can just jump over this -- i &apos;ll just jump the video instead ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is up ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year out and work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much everything you hate , we made them work in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s kind of like the geeks peace corps for geeks .
we select some fellows every year , and we let them work with city administration .
instead of sending them to the third world , we &apos;re sending them in city users .
and they came up with great apps , working with urban collaborators .
but what they really do is show what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so they meet al .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is somebody who &apos;s releasing him when he &apos;s interfered , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at branding when he &apos;s covered by a meter snow .
how did he get to searching for help in this particular way ?
last year , we had a team of fellows in boston , and we had the code for america program .
they were there in february , and it did a lot of work last february .
and they realized that the city never frees these hydrant freely .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik antels-ober , noticed something else , and that was that the people who were freely swallowed the sidewalk , right in front of those parts .
so he did what any good developers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you feel free to scare him when he &apos;s screaming .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote in the last year .
but it does something that no other governance technology does .
it &apos;s rapidly spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. division of the city of honolulu , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but in order to adopt the citizens of tsunami-sirated animals .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirings work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean up the clogged gullys .
and chicago just introduced them so that people could freak out the incremental scares when it &apos;s sniffing .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it &apos;s got ruthless , organic , of course .
when you know about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t normally go like this .
this is a piece of software that typically takes a few years .
we had a team that was working on a project last year in boston , and it took three people two and a half months to do this .
it was a method where parents can figure out which are the right public schools for their children .
we were told later that if it was going to go over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and this is nothing else .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california justice , which costs the taxpayers two billion dollars so far , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app that is written in a few days , and then rarely expanded is a kind of a session before the bug &apos;s institution for government .
it shows how government could work better -- not like a private company , how many people think it should .
and not even like a technology company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , the app is that it represents a new generation packaged the problem of government -- not as the problem of financial institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to actually tackle things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country writing up and writing government aps every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they repair it .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from our eyes .
and that &apos;s when you forget all of your feelings about politics and the snake at work and all the other things that we really excited about is government , in the core , in tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; what we do in common is not alone . &quot;
today a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you that you think about it , because things are changing .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government eventually exposed their power from us -- he remind you , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about it , changes how that change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and like many people , i thought that the government was mainly about choosing people in a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s mainly in communities , the thylacines .
this is the call center for service and information .
and that &apos;s where you usually get out when you call in your city 311 .
if you ever have a chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , do you all -- you &apos;ll see that the people call the government for many different problems , including a cleaner in your house .
so scott gets this fruit .
he typed &quot; thylacine &quot; to the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the animal beginner .
and finally he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock skin ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
it &apos;s not just a call center in boston .
it has an app , a web and cell app , called &quot; citizens connect . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write the app .
this is the work that &apos;s very smart people at the new urban mechanics office in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in this : &quot; marsupial rat in my trash bin . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
scott interacted from man to human .
but on &quot; citizens connect &quot; is all publicly so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it was a neighbor .
and the next entry that we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the landfill behind the house .
exploiting ? yes . alive ? yap .
turned the garbage pitch on the page . went home .
good night , sweet smoke . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is the digital physical thing .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how government is to get this crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily talking about a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
she connected these two people .
and you could have linked them to state performers if they needed it , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if one neighbor helps the other , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call the animal beginners , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to remember this is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to choose .
how often do we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we have used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we reject ourselves , and we expect the government to reflect our values and our needs satisfied , and then not much change ?
this is because the government is like a farther ocean and politics is the top of 15 inches .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that this thing that we own , and that we pay for , will be something that works against us , something else , and then we set ourselves up .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual governance is going on .
we need to engage in the government &apos;s machinery .
so the occupythesec movement has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed 325-page report , who wrote an answer to sec-memo about the legislation of financial reform .
this is not political , this is bureaucratic .
now , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time for us to think about the world we want to leave our children behind .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to do what we need to do without improving an institution that can act on behalf of us all ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to promote the function of government in a way that can actually achieve something by empowering society .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up mitdem internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to build the right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation growing up with seeing their voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight we &apos;re all fighting for who to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can stand your mind on every channel at any time , and you can do it .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government &apos;s work .
and these apps let &apos;s use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be to freak up a fire hydrant , chising the shack , turning a trash can with a thylacine rat .
and surely , we could have unleashed these fire hydrants all the time , and a lot of people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government who pay and get services done .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we have to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
and my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming up will be , and i thought , being here under my friends , i would tell you what i really think is , and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s really going on with these incredible jumps .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single boring slide for a moment .
if you could just run the slide for a second .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen from my folder by accident .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , it &apos;s about the general shape .
this slide shows us data from analyzing the performance of risc processors compared to the power of a local area networks .
what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like so few others , which we often meet in our field , is a kind of straight on a semi-logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here is a potential in the capacity scale .
and this is a novelty that we have to use this guy , scale on semi-logarithmic curve in the field of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so if you could turn that light back on , please .
a little more brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper right here .
now , why do we draw graphers in technology on semi-logarithmic curves ?
the reason for that is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years here , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a random mass of technology that i want to do with a graph , then the graph becomes silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transportation technology , that would come on the semi-logarithmic scale very unreasonably in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the qualitative circumstances .
so if the transportation technology was progressing as fast as the microprocessor technology was going on , tomorrow we could go into a taxi tomorrow , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not going to be so fast .
this has never been in the history of technology development before , this kind of recursive growth , which will increase the order of magnitude exponentially every few years .
now the question i want to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , you see , they don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything has evolved forever and eternal as fast as it is now .
there are two options .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic curve like this , until something completely new comes in , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s kind of it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen here .
so that &apos;s really the case , then that means we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question that i would like to ask , and i would often ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new condition that &apos;s starting to acquire the world ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was another kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now , here &apos;s a conference where people are talking about the future , and you realize that the future is still in the year 2000 .
further than that , we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future has shrunk by a year since i was in this world every year .
and i think the reason for this is that we find that something is going on .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that at the moment it just doesn &apos;t make sense to try 30 or 50 years to look into the future , because everything will be so different , that a simple calculation of what we &apos;re doing now makes no sense .
now , i want to talk about what this could be , this transition that we are in the moment .
so to do that , i &apos;m going to talk about a couple of other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers first .
because i think in order to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at the thing on a longer scale of time .
and i want to look at this on the scale of life on earth .
i think the overall picture makes sense if you divide it into a couple of billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , sterile rock blobs with lots of sulfur chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals have been organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they did that .
i think there are theories that start to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of what is that , at that time , little oil drops carried around , which contain different kinds of recipes for chemicals .
some of these oil dropts had a special combination of chemicals , which allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside , and therefore grow .
all of them were like this started to divide .
these little oil drivers were the most primitive cell form in the sense .
but these oil dropts weren &apos;t about living in the sense of today , because each one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it &apos;s divided , the chemicals in it have distributed into unequal quantities .
so each droplet was a little bit different .
in fact , the drivers grew , which had one for the growth of the more optical composition , faster than others , integrated more and more chemicals from outside , and divided faster .
so these nuts tend to survive longer , and they multiply in size .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting if these comfort learned a trick about abstraction .
now , in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand yet , these fears have learned to decrease the ability to attribute information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they found a way in this libertless , evolutionary way that allowed them to attribute what they were , so that this information could be stored and copied .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information has stayed out of the time of 2.5 billion years in which it was originated , stayed the same .
in fact , the recipe for us is our genes , from the exact same code and the same writing .
and it &apos;s every living thing that uses exactly the same letter and the same code .
we are so far that we can , just for the purpose of pleasure , put yourself in this code .
and i have 100 micrograms of a white sweater , which i &apos;m trying to keep in the airports of security staff .
it &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made up of normal letters that we use to symbolize -- and i &apos;ve written my visitenmap on a piece of dna , and it empowers 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a selfish , i would have written it on a virus and released it into the space .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the decrease of dna was an interesting step .
and that led these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another very interesting step happened , where things got completely different , which was these cells starting to communicate and share information , so that communities emerged from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
and that &apos;s why , for example , the consistency grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found that they can stay away from penicillin and have written this information together with other bacteria in dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria are communicating with each other .
and this communication now allowed the reasons of communities that were in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were synertic .
so they either survived together , or they went down , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated more and preferred by evolution .
now the transition site is where these communities are so close together , that they are determined to write the recipe for the entire community into a drawing chain on the dna .
and the next interesting period took about another billion years .
at this point we have multicellular communities , communities of many different cell types , which together as a single organism .
in fact , we are such multicellular community as well .
we have lots of cells that are no longer on their own .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started to evolve , so that the level on which evolution was taking place was no longer the individual cell , but the whole cell community that we call the organism .
the next step has happened within these communities .
cell communities began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t do anything but to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information workforce that these cell communities have built .
they started to educate specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point an individual -- learning has happened within the time of a single organism &apos;s lifespan , rather than these evolutionary span of time .
so one organism could learn to eat a particular fruit , for example , because she liked bad and made him sick , the last time he eaten them .
now this could happen within the life of a single organism , whereas it took hundreds of thousands of years , because this information had to be evolutionarily learned by the individuals who died because of these fruits , because these information processing structures weren &apos;t there yet .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process , using this particular information structure , because evolution has now been able to take place within an individual .
it could take place within a newspapers of learning .
and what happened then is the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
once in an example , the most sophisticated version of this communication type is human language .
it &apos;s a quite amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , straightforward and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically adding grunting notes of me , hoping to create a similar confusion idea in your head that has a certain similarity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , we convert it into sound , a sequence of notes , and we produce something very complicated in the minds of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , humanity , is we started to abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages that have been through multi-cell organisms -- the abstraction of our methods of holding data , presenting data .
for example , the invention of the language was a small step in that direction .
telephony , computers , video recorders , cd-roms , and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to handle that information .
and it connects us all together to something which is much bigger , and it &apos;s able to evolve faster than we have been .
so today evolution can happen in the time span of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen tys &apos;s little evolutionary example , where he showed a little bit of evolution in the convolution program , right in front of your eyes .
so now we speed the timeline again .
the first step in history that i told you is a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , continued several hundred million years .
then the next step , like language and so on , continued less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem just a few decades to take .
the process feeds itself , and so i think , auto-catalytic is the word for it -- if something improves its change velocity .
the more it changes , the faster it is changing .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion curve .
we see the process that feeds itself from itself .
i live reasonably by building computers , and i know that i can &apos;t use the mechanism that i use to build computers without the recent advances in computer technology .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in the assembly machine .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking machines are doing is , we think , at some abstract level , we overcome this machine and the machine is doing something that goes far beyond our capabilities , better than we could ever do .
and she does it in part with the ways that we don &apos;t even understand properly till now .
so one way that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using a lot of time lately is evolution itself .
and what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re installing an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microsecond area .
to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program which emerges from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , generous please , a hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions .
now , please run all of these randomly chosen instructions , run all the programs , and then finally the ones that i prescribe to the next . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;m beginning to define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , which would be a simple example , which i &apos;ve been using for it already .
so , find some programs that can take care of the most marginal numbers .
of course , if you happen to have chosen instructions , you have a very small chance of sort numbers at random , so i don &apos;t think any of the instructions will actually do this .
but one of them may be lucky to be two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the consequences that have come next .
remember this one , put the rest out .
now , reproduces all the remains that have best sorted numbers .
and this is a method of recombining , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they make children through the exchange exchange of their subroutines , and the children decrease the characteristics of the subroutines of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that have come from combinations of programs that have come a little bit closer than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
rate it again .
may lead some mutations .
and try to do it again with another generation .
all of these generations just take a few milliseconds .
and so i can have evolution over millions of years in the computer in a few minutes , or in more complicated cases , i can run through a few hours .
and then finally , i get programs that can perfectly do numbers .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write by hand .
and then when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s prescriptions and odd programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure you get the job done , because you come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because their lives depend on whether they did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , ale he reaches a map and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there it says , &quot; this airplane is made of hundreds of thousands of pieces that work together to make their flight safer . don &apos;t that make you more comfortable ? &quot;
we know that a process of development is not optimal when it gets too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process that is very different from classical engineering .
it allows us things to produce much more complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of this yet .
so the technology is sort of flooding us .
we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so that we can do these processes even faster .
so it creates a feedback log .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies today are feeding on themselves .
we &apos;re going to move off .
we got to a point where the analog is at the time , when one cell organisms have evolved into multiple cell organisms .
so we &apos;re the outs , and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell we &apos;re actually doing here .
we are in the middle of this transition point .
but i really think there &apos;s something else going on after us .
i find it very hard to tell us that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of whatever is coming next .
now , lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to stop here before i get chosen .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the starve sky in the desert with sufi singer mukhtiar ali .
we talked about it that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian epos called mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to go to indians back then , we jumped into a car and snapped over the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
back then , when the great indian warrior prince arjuna had been able to do it , he took an arc , shot into the floor and water stepped in .
now we do this with drillers and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got a little scared of technology .
it scared me that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset with no camera and no tweet to my friends .
i found technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver clock watch .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
it became a golden access to a world full of pirate and unhappy ships and images in my imagination .
i thought it was as if our fancy clocks and cameras were dreaming about it .
they kept us inspired by that .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than kill .
at 16 , i started illustrating books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that readers can connect around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s bringing pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
storytelling needs more and more senses .
but what do we do with that ?
i &apos;m just going to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- it says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i &apos;m writing my name there .
and from me , i become a character in the book .
and again , a letter comes down for me -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- which is really addressed to me .
the kid in me is really enthusiastic about this kind of opportunity .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i mean , not magicians and dragons , i mean the fence of childhood , those ideas that we all have as children .
fireflies in a glass i always found quite exciting .
so here you have to type out the ipad and make the fireflies out .
and they were illuminating the journey through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be stuck in a single marble .
and so every book here , and every world becomes a little marble , which i take over here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasybooks have always had maps , but these cards were static .
this map is growing and lighting and serving for orientation in the rest of the book .
it also shows you in other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indish , but it &apos;s also very timmy .
these are the apsaras .
we &apos;ve all heard of fees and nymps , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras had caught thousands of years in indras chamber , in an old muffy book .
and we bring them back in a contemporary story for children .
a story that &apos;s engaging with new opportunities , such as the environmental crisis .
the issue of environmental crisis , a big problem for the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms , sitting on their computers , without getting out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children to the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect with the camera of ipads images of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of sticks , stones , peaks and sells .
somehow , children don &apos;t do it anymore .
this childhood ritual is returned . you have to go out to take a picture of a flower in a chapter and tag a picture of a flower .
in another chapter , you have to photograph and mark a piece of structural mri .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can then put online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a food and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox today . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a ape today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of connecting magic to the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you &apos;re using the video of ipads , and by augmented reality , we &apos;re looking at an animation of 11 that appears on a plant in front of the house .
there &apos;s a place where the screen is filled with petals .
you have to make the sound of the winds , you blow them away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural technology comes closer and is able to approach the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and us closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of history .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time working with people in investigative , prisons or death cells .
i spend most of my time hanging with the socially weaker in the social construction settlements and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
to be here at ted , to see and to hear how stimulating this is gave me a lot of power .
in the short time , i realized one thing : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence in the world .
and sometimes , when something comes across ted , it gets a meaning and a force that would not have .
i say that because i believe that identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentation .
i believe that we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher matter , but the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful .
you can do good as a doctor , but if you &apos;re a care doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer , by the way .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african-american household dominated by a matriarch , and this matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a gun , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every family argument .
it was also the origin of many disputes in our family .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
their parents were born in the 1840s in virginia as a slave .
she was born around 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped her worldview very strongly .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and hugged me .
she struck me so depressed that i could barely breathe . then she let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and when i said , &quot; no , &quot; she hugged me again . when i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she left me alone .
she was something that made you always wanted to be around you .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins were walking around everywhere .
i remember i have to have been eight or nine that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins were running around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room staring at me .
i thought at first that was a game .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
that was about 15 or 20 minutes . and then she stood up and came over to me . she took me by the hand , and she said , &quot; oh , bryan . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i still remember it was like it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
and she took me out and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you &apos;re not going to go on . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , oma . &quot;
she said , &quot; honor word ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i watched you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to tell you your mommy will always love . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you &apos;re always going to take care of her . &quot;
i honored my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; the next thing i want you to do is to always do the right thing . &quot; although it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is that you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land in old , rural south , and i have a brother that &apos;s older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , my brother came home one day and took this sixpack of beer and grabbed my sister and i and went to the forest with us .
we just alert around the same way that we did .
and then he took a gorgeous beer , and he offered my sister one , and she assumed , and then they offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . just do it . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , we &apos;re going to do this now , you &apos;re going to do whatever we &apos;re doing now .
i had what , your sister had something . go , drink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just do you . just do you . &quot;
my brother started to stare me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now drink something . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not still doing yourself crazy because of entertainment with oma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; oma tells all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this may be transmitted to the public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m standing that i &apos;ve never drunk a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s virtuous . i &apos;m saying that because identity is power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us things that they don &apos;t believe first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all of their grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in jail prohibition .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
and she believed that these were the topics that we have to take care of .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in prisoners and in jail .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest incarceration rate in the world .
seven million people are released to currency or with condition deprivation .
in my opinion , mass incarcerations have fundamentally changed our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population , there &apos;s despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one out of three black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , leaving for currency or in a condition .
in urban communities all over the country -- los angeles on philadelphia , baltimore washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black men are either in prison , repurposing or in condition .
but our system is not only shaped by questions that have to do with rapid belonging , it &apos;s also discharged by poverty .
we have a justice system in this country that they &apos;re much better treated when they &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not debt , affects the outcome .
yet , we seem to be pretty satisfied with that .
a policy of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some very interesting developments .
my home state of alabama draws you permanently the right to vote when you &apos;re sentenced to sentencing .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black people are permanently losing their election right .
we predicted that in 10 years , the rate of acknowledging civil rights is going to be as high as they said before the election rule of choice .
the silence is ear anesthesia .
i perform children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the three-year-olds children , are destined to death in jail .
in this country , we have life punishment for children without conditions .
we already have a lot of things going on .
the only country in the world .
i represented people in death cells .
the death penalty issue is an interesting question .
we believe that we &apos;ve taught ourselves that the real question is , does a human being deserve to die for a crime of him ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think about it differently , depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : did someone deserve for crimes a death , but : do we deserve to kill ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people that we &apos;ve executed comes one that we &apos;ve found for innocent , which has been discharged and released from the death cell . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
an amazing failure rate . one in nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane , if you had nine planes to pick up , one falls off .
but somehow , we &apos;re going to move away from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students to educate african-american history . i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , time against the end of reconstruction , all the way to the beginning of world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for african-american in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be scared of lynchmobs .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped their lives .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , you talk about them . they tell people to stop saying we have to do it for the first time in the history of our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , race rendering and decades of racially motivated submission and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand the importance of our actions in historical context .
we are constantly pushing each other .
we are always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard for us to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the rail race is not to overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists got up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear them talk like this . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death penalty .
and of course , in germany , you can never give it anymore . &quot;
there was a silence , and then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we will ever speak again for the systematic killing of people .
it would be knowing us to be aware and targeted people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how would it feel to live in a world where the german state ran people , especially if there were a lot of jews under proportion .
it would be intolerable .
it would be ignorable .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we fix people -- here &apos;s the risk of being sentenced to death , 11 times higher if the victim is white than if it &apos;s black . 22 times higher when the alignment is black and the body is white .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disclosure .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with these difficult topics , then the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but after all , these realities are overscattered by suffering , abuse , composition , limitation .
it seems to me that it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about it , we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to be able to pass in a complex world .
for me , time is to stop thinking and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , the ones that will never be at ted .
but thinking in a way that &apos;s integrated in our own lives .
we all have to believe , after all , things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . as rational as we are , we estimate so much intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by persuasion in our hearts .
it &apos;s this head-heart connection , which i think drives us , not just to be open for all the light and exciting things , but also for the dark and problematic .
vaclav havel , the great cherish politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought against oppression , we wanted everything , but what we most needed was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness , sometimes to be in hopeless places , and to be witnessing . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe also the ted communities have to be engaged in this .
there &apos;s no limitation for technology and design that allows us to be fully human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , boundary and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
it will deeply touch it .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;ve been privileged to meet rosa parks .
ms. parks used to come back to montgomery , where they train two of their oldest friends , these elderly women , johnnie carr , who had organized the montomery-boykott -- an incredible african-american and virginia durer , a white man .
so these women met , and they were just talking .
occasionally , woman carr then called me and said , &quot; bryan , wife parks comes into the city . we want to have a conversation .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , i like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just listened .
it was always so inspiring , so refugee .
and one day i sat there , and i listened to these women , and after a couple of hours , wife parks turned to me and said , &quot; well , bryan , tell me what the clinic was right for the same initiative .
what do they try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to prefer against injustice .
wr wants to help people convicted innocent .
we want to address forestry and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
we want to deploy lifelong inquiry without conditioning for children .
we want to do something about death penalty .
we want to lower the number of offensive lenses .
we want to create mass ingenuity . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and after that , she looked at me and she said , &quot; mmm . hmm . hmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make them very , very tired . &quot;
then , woman carr sat down in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be taper .
we need to find ways to make these challenges : these problems , these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our all humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a couple very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every human on the planet .
if you lie , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to him , it &apos;s not just a theft .
even who kills someone is not just a killer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so scary , we won &apos;t be measured in our technology , not in the things we develop , not on our intellect and minds .
and finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the convicted , the incarcerated .
because in that context , we &apos;re first beginning to grasp the really amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story at the end .
sometimes i push too much .
i get tired , like all of us .
sometimes these ideas will envy our minds in a very important way .
i represented these kids that were sentenced to very hard punishment .
i go to college and i go to a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and he &apos;s supposed to be on trial as an adult .
and then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something he &apos;s not ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed up too long , and i thought , oh my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have magic forces .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
you should have some wishes as well .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think about it anymore , i started working on a request .
i had a 14-year-old poor black boy as a client .
and i started on this request . the headline was , &quot; commissioned to treat my poor , 14-year-old black clients such as a privileged white , 75-year-old top managers . &quot;
in my assignment , i explained that the misconduct of the state homeland and the police and criminal failures were to be accepted .
there was a crazy line about that , in this country , there &apos;s no longer a lot of time that there &apos;s any failures .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i just dreamed this crazy assignment or actually wrote it .
and to my dismay , i had not just written it , but also sent to the dish .
a few months before , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to put this in the court and this crazy case .
i got in the car and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
finally , i got out of my car , and i went up the staircase .
when i got up the staircase to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitor in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and hugged me .
and then he whispered me in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power to me .
it touched something very deep inside me , identity , the ability of every single , to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i walked into the court .
as soon as the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you get this insane assignment ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more and more people came in just because they were angry .
i &apos;d written these crazy things .
police officers came in and deputy leaders and offices .
in trade , the court was full of people who were angry that we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my point of view , i looked up and down the janitors .
he would see through the window over and over and over and over and over and hear the whole tohuwabohu .
he went up and down .
after all , this older black man came in the court with a very concerned facial ruck in the court , and he sat right behind me , almost on the defense bank .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
during the break , a police officer came in , and it was disturbing that the janitors was in the court .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the court ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i came here to say this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal from the eyes . don &apos;t give it up . &quot;
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is going to vibrate , but it &apos;s going to increase justice .
that we &apos;re not fully designed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t take care of human rights and basic values .
that our entire survival is connected to the survival of every single one .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and creation , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want to share with you guys who see this as well , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal from your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen and heard in this audience , this community , an obvious wish , and you have to help them and do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , in this spring , there &apos;s a folk decid that it &apos;s about actually taking a effort to do something from the money power that otherwise will be run into the politics of punishment . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ;
here , in california , for example , in the next five years , you &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty . a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all killed delights do not end up with a hazard .
56 percent of rapes do not come in court .
there &apos;s a chance to do something here .
this reviewer is going to suggest to invest the money in more security bugs and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the crime rate in america has dropped immense .
this fact is often put in a context with the increase in incarceration numbers .
what would you tell someone that believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of violent crime didn &apos;t change very much .
most of the mass incarcerations in this country didn &apos;t really find anything in the class of violent crime .
it was the misguided crow against drugs .
that &apos;s why the dramatic high numbers come to the prison inmates .
we were ripping down from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; three-story laws that bring people behind bars forever , for a bicycle theft , for the theft of good , rather than forcing them to give back the sacrifice of the sacrifices .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become the victim of a criminal , not less .
and i think our current criminal justice system doesn &apos;t help it .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , they actually brought a string on the swings here .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
bin laden &apos;s death brings an elevated risk of driving .
pucha : famine in somalia . speaker 3 : pepper spray of the police .
bad cartelle . speakers 5 : dangerous cross-flight ships .
6 : societal decline . speaker 7 : 65 deaths .
adjacent 8 : tsunofficial warning . speaker 9 : cyberattacks
different speakers : drugs war . weapons of mass destruction . tornado .
recession . still . doomsday . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative subjects , because our minds are paying attention to those issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second , our senses are tracking a lot more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first position for all of this information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our driving detector .
it carries and carries through all of the information that &apos;s looking for any kind of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it flows , the demand &quot; is very true .
well , with all of our digital devices , seven days a week , we &apos;re making all these negative news 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle of pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s going to be worse and worse in the world .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done over the last century is going to accelerate through a series of forces so strong that it &apos;s going to allow us to create a world of abundance in the next three decades .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , drugs die , water and energy problems -- we already have .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking at problems in a very long way , but eventually they &apos;re overcoming it .
now , let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so that we can anticipate the development .
over the last hundred years , average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has tripled to inflation &apos;s average income in the world &apos;s population .
child mortality has dropped by a tenth .
and the thing is that the food , electricity transportation and communication costs have decreased a multiplily amount of decrease . &amp; lt ; em &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
steve pinker showed us that we are living in a very peaceful time in human history right now .
and according to charles kenny , the literacy rate in the past 130 years from 25 percent to 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people forget this .
and we continue to increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
think that a great fraction of americans living under the poverty line , access to power , water , toilets , refrigerators , television phones , climate phones , cars and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the earth &apos;s imperators , could never have dreamed such a luxury .
so , the foundations of this are a lot of technologies , and these grow expotentially .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that becomes information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , makes a big jump , and doubles the price performance quotient every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less , and is a thousand-fold faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , as custom as she &apos;s lost -- in good times , in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and rejuncture .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it slows down for none of our big problems .
furthermore , despite their logarithmic trajectory on the left , it will go upward .
so the rate of growth itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the backs of moore &apos;s law , we find a range of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; what my friends call &quot; infinite computing , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow us to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , vaccines and food , digital medicine and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm &apos;s supercomputer watson at risk ?
now , that was grandios .
i once performed the newspapers and looked for the best headlines i could find .
i love this one : &quot; watson forces human enemies . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the numbers of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence of every owner of a mobile phone gives us a mobile phone .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i started a new university here at ted called singularity university .
we bring all of these students to all of these technologies , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask students to create products and services that can include lives of billions of people &apos;s lives .
think about a group of students today that can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today , in dozens of companies that have done this .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating abundance from scarce goods .
because scarcity is contextual , and technology is an unleashing force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii. in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleon &apos;s soldiers got silver steck , napoleon himself received gold-beck .
but the king of siam was actually getting aluminum steck .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet at that time , more valuable than gold and platin .
this is why the dome of the washing monument was made from aluminum .
even though aluminum 8.3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it &apos;s not going to be the pure metal .
it &apos;s linked to oxygen and silicon .
but then the technology of electrolysis was developed and made aluminum manufacturing so cheap that we use it with our throwaway mentality .
and then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we &apos;re thinking about energy scarcity today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with 5,000-times more energy than we use every year .
16 terawatts of energy prashes every 88 minutes on earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not scarcity , the problem is accessibility .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , the first time you &apos;ve ever been able to reduce the cost of solar power in india , 50 percent of the same stroke -- 8.8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar power has dropped by 50 percent last year .
last month , this published with a study that shows that by the end of this decade , solar energy is going to cost solar , six cents a kwh , compared to 15 cents a national average .
and if we have a session of energy , we will also have water flow in the surplus .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
remember , when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft , 1990 , when it moved to saturn , back towards earth ?
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that is 70 percent covered in water .
yes , it &apos;s 97.5 percent salt water , two percent are dirt , and we &apos;re fighting 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope here too .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologies around the way , nano-materials .
and from a conversation today with dean kaman , one of the innovators of the do it yourself , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his technolgy called &quot; slingshot , &quot; which many of you may have heard about . it &apos;s the size of a student .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latin -- and all of that for less than two cents a liter .
the head of coca-cola has just agreed to launch a big test project with a hundred units in the developing world .
and when everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , coca-cola is going to apply this technology globally in 206 countries around the planet .
this is technology support innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
oh my goodness , we &apos;ll soon reach the 70 percent degrees of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just consider that a masai warrior with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you &apos;re looking for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , as nobody could ever have predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i spent a couple of thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photo , libraries full of books and music , technology to the medical diagnostics -- are now literally intangible and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best thing about this is possibly what we might expect in health .
last month , i had the pleasure , with the qualcommand foundation , to announce the so-called &quot; $ 10 million qualcomm tricorder &apos;s x prize . &quot;
we &apos;re asking teams around the world to connect all of these technologies together in a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ki , you can test in your hat or your blood values .
and to win , the device needs to make a better diagnosis than a team of high-qualified doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the burden of disease and 1.3 percent of the health staff .
if this device sequences a rna- or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it will call the health agency and prevents a pandemic before its outbreak .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
and just by the way , the biggest insurance against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition around the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re predicting two to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard of before will close up global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to pray ?
and instead of economic standstill , i see one of the greatest economic credit in history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are being flown into the global economy .
and they will be healthier by using the tricoder , and they will be more trained by the khan-academy , and in doing so that they will have the opportunity to use 3d printer and &quot; ite computing &quot; much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community bring us ?
how about a sentence of new , never heard before .
how about giving a voice to the oppressed wherever you are , to make a voice , and to create change , for the first time , for the very first time ?
what will these three billion people bring to ?
what about the examples that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that great companies and governments could only do in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excited me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know .
it &apos;s a game called &quot; tordit . &quot;
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
according to its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so this has been a problem for supercomputers so far .
and this game was played by university professors , etc .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that nowadays , human pattern recognition better folds the proteins than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best proton folder in the world , this was not a mit professor , also not a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was a writer during a rehab clinic and worked the best time .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals today to make us the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropes .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i believe that we have to do something against a changing piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical scientist , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in the business for a long time , as if i can allow myself to give up a piece of my own false premise making that possible .
but before i get to the actual issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the sacred , and we &apos;re moving to the world &apos;s championship .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball &quot; comes soon , and it rotates statistics , and to use it to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to go to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we talk about 300 if a bat is 300 .
that means that the player will surely beat three out of 10 sleeps .
that is to put the ball in the field , it &apos;s coming up , it &apos;s not caught , and who has tried to throw the ball at first base , it hasn &apos;t been done on time , and the runner was safe .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a 300th of major league baseball ?
all right , really good , maybe a all-star .
do you know what you call a 400th ?
this is someone who , by the way , is safe to meet four out of 10 .
legendary -- as ted williams legendary -- the last major league baseball player ever met during a regular season of over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot of good , or maybe a little less comfortable with that i &apos;ve talked to you about .
suppose you &apos;ve got a blind integration , and you &apos;re transferred to an operator whose average performance is 400 in terms of blindness .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved person with clogged cardiac heart vessels and your household refers to a cardiologist whose average performance is in colorful representation in 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the rising branch .
and it &apos;s going to beat a 257 .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think of the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic , a birthday worker , should be a rescue assistant ?
one thousand , very good .
the truth is that no one in all the medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a rescue assistant should be .
but what we do , though , is that we each of them , including me , send me in the world to be perfect with the claim .
never make a mistake , but no one cares about the details of how this is supposed to be done .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
i was a 20-obsessive student .
in high school , a schoolman once said that brian goldmann would learn a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little dachstube in the sisters residence at the toronto hospital , far from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatomic lecture , i learned the origins and executives of every muskels , each branch of any artery that triggers away from aorta , obscure and ordinary differential diagnoses .
i actually knew the differential diagnosis to classify renal-tubulasty acican .
and all the time , i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i graduated from cum laude .
and i left medical school with the impression that if i knew everything and knew everything , or anything like possible , i was as close as possible as i could , that i was immun against mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met a woman printer .
i resided a teaching hospital here in toronto as a woman printer to me in the emergency department of the hospital .
at this point , i was admitted to the cardiological service at the cardiological service .
and it was my commission when the emergency personnel were looking for cardiological council to study the emergency patient .
and to give feedback to my high school physician .
i studied woman printer , and she was in breathroom .
and when i listened to her , she made chiming sounds .
and when i heard her chest with the stethoscope , i was able to hear a crap noise on both sides that told me that she suffered from a gesture of heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart fails , instead of pumping all the blood , a part of the flower is stuck in the lung and fills that back in time , so the shortness came .
and that was not a hard way to do diagnosis .
i hired them , and i took care of them .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine , which we call diuretics , water tablets , so that she goodbye the fluid .
and over a period of one and a half to two hours , she started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my supreme physician .
i didn &apos;t take up the listeners , and i did what to have been a call on my supreme doctor to tell him that he had a chance to have a sense of his own image .
and he knew that he would have been able to contribute extra information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s aid .
maybe i wanted to take so successfully and be able to take the responsibility that i was so negotiating , and so i would be able to worry for my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
and by sending them home , i missed a voice in me who was trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it really lacked me so much confidence that i asked the nurse , who took care of woman printers , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when she goes home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and said in a more real way , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to be good for her . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
so i signed the relay tapes and a clinician and a rescue assistant , and i brought them home .
and i went back to work .
for the rest of the day , that night i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , read the hospital , and went to the parking lot to go home with the car when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
i went home through the emergency department .
and there was another nurse saying , not the nurse who had seen after woman printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear most emergency doctors i know .
other doctors are afraid of this as well , but the emergency medicine is special , because we only see the patients fleeting so volatile .
the three words said , do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient you put home ? &quot;
the nurse asked .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular sound .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she got home , after i sent her home , she collapsed and the family called 911 . the rescue assistants brought her back to the emergency clinic with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous shock state .
she hardly breathed and walked blue .
the emergency nurses moved all the strands .
they would give their blood pressure increases .
they put them on the atm machine .
i was shocked . i was shocked to the inner .
and i was living through this rollercoaster , because she was coming to the intensive care after she stops , and i was hoping she was going to recover .
and after two , three days , it realized that she was never going to wake up again .
she &apos;d suffered a non-treatable brain damage .
their family got together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they made a disconnect .
the other day they would read them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
it &apos;s said that you don &apos;t forget the names of those dying .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next couple of weeks , i went ahead and i first found myself the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame when you have a secret of the best friend &apos;s prize , even though that one on a prior and then you get caught and the best friend confronts you and my terrible discussion , when you end up having a bad conscience and you &apos;re never going to make a mistake again .
if you do repetition and never do the mistake again .
that &apos;s the kind of teacher shame .
the unhealthy way i talk about is the one that makes you inherently sick .
it &apos;s the one who tells you that what you &apos;re doing is not what you &apos;re doing bad , but you &apos;re bad at yourself .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t at the bottom of my head , he was very dear .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was smoking the weekends and sure that i was not going to be sued .
but i was continuing to ask myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the translator ? why did i send her home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly , but it made it safe .
i started feeling better .
and then on a oil day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke down , and i might feel better again .
and i negotiated with myself that if i double my efforts to perfection and i never again make a mistake that the voice could get silenced .
and she did it .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergency ward in a community hospital north of toronto , and i guessed a 25 year-old man with mature revenue .
it was a lot of go , and i was in a hurry .
he was always showing up here .
i looked in the pickle , and it was a little bit of pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and then when he went out of the door , he pointed out on his picks .
two days later , i came to my nearest emergency service , and my chedyer asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember yourself ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the patients who was traveling ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a streptococ-infection .
he had a potentially endangered disease called epiglottitis .
you can google the googlen , but it &apos;s not infection of the revenue , but the upper lanes , and it causes the conclusion of the paths .
and fortunately , he did not die .
he got intravenous antibotica and got himself a few days later .
and i went back through the same torture of shame and self-doubt , felt readily , and went out of the work until it happened again and again and again .
in an emergency layer , i &apos;ve monitored two times a blind integration .
there &apos;s a lot of it already , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that &apos;s only 14 patients per night at that time .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no man in their treatment as well .
one was i thought he had kidneys .
i ordered the x-ray of the kidneys , and when the without the fund was , my colleague , in the reception of the patient , put a hazard in the lower right sector , and i called the operators .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i put fluids in order to rehydrate him , and i asked my colleagues to watch him as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he set up a hazard in the right sector , he called the operator .
in both cases , they operated , and they did well .
both of these cases hit me , just wake me up .
and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years , which was a lot of my colleagues claim , but total nonsense .
some of my klute happened over the last five years .
alone , shame and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t finish my mistakes and talk about them , if i can &apos;t agree with my body voice , which really can &apos;t find what was happening , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i &apos;m in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who was talking about failures about failures ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party , and you like to hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talk about your own mistakes .
if i were to go in a room full of colleagues and ask for their sovereign support and tell them what i &apos;ve just told you , i probably wouldn &apos;t get to the end of the second story before it would be really awkward , anyone would confuse a joke , they would change the rest and the rest of the rest .
and in fact , if i knew my colleagues that an orthopedic in my hospital would have taken someone the wrong leg , then trust me i &apos;d have problems with him .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of errors .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t make . those who constrain the sleep deprivation and the lack of constraints that have bad outcomes and good outcomes .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we let the ones that make the mistakes out of medicine , that we have a safe system .
but there are two problems with this .
in my about 20 years of medical consciousness and journalism , i did a personal medical study on medical errors and wrong treatments to learn all the possible for one of my first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show &quot; white coat , black art . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely intangible .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day mistakes occurs , where one out of 10 medications is either a wrong or wrong , in which hospital-acquired infections are always , and countless and devastation or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of comprehensible mistakes .
in the united states , the institute for medicine is the number at 100,000 .
both of these are strong discharges , because we don &apos;t look at the problem in the same way that we should .
and it &apos;s the crux .
in a hospital system where medical medical record is doubled every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so that we can take a perfect payoff of disease for a patient with breast pain .
then i take the same patient with chest pain , and i sweat it , and i sweat it , and i give it a slightly alcolic breath to it , and all of a sudden the story is replaced with contempt contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things in the same way .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these things are inevitable .
so if you take the system the way i &apos;ve been taught , and all the miscarved health professionals are discarded , there &apos;s no one left at the end .
and do you know the ladders of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white coat , black art . &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would show to everyone from the rescue assistant to the kardiologist , &quot; this is my worst mistake blah , blah , blah and blah ? &quot;
and then their pupilles expand , they came in front of their head , and they look down and they swallow , and they start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i made . &quot;
what you need is an environment that puts them in a position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the re-defined physician is a person , knowing his humanity , accepted her , is not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s all set of it to learn from them so that there can be passed on .
she shares her experiences with others .
it supports people when they talk about their mistakes .
and it shows other people whose mistakes , not to show up , but in a lovely , supportive way so that everybody benefits .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes people filling the system with life , and if that &apos;s , then people also make mistakes from time to time .
so that the system evolves to create backups that make it easier to seek out , that makes people inevitably inevitably secure , and also providing supportive , supportive spaces in which health care can actually address things that are going to be provided and actually perpetrated for expossessed and the other people who are preciviable to be the biased and the other times that are preceding the biased and the biased and the way that are previewed for the bias many times that are preciviable to be in the health care and the people who are in particular ways that will be able to be able to be in particular ways that are preciviable to be seen for the way that are preciviable to be the health care and the way that it can actually accomplished for the health care and the health care and actually accomplished for the people who are preceding the health care and the biased and the way that are preciviable to do that are preciviable to be a reward me and the biased and the biased and the people and the system that will be able to be able to be in particular ways that will be considered the way that will be seen .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the redefined doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m unfortunate . but i &apos;m trying to learn best to pass it on to others .
i don &apos;t know what they do with me , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about transformational standards .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories before to use time .
the first story is by charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was here in 1835 .
you might think that he chased finkens , but that &apos;s not true .
he actually collected fish .
he described one of them as very , very common .
it was a groupers .
until the &apos; 80s , it was fished at a big scale .
now it &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
this is a story that we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos islands , or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet , we &apos;re still approaching the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the brokles are still describing them as untouched .
what happened here ?
the second story is to illustrate a different concept , the transformational wasteful of days-on .
because i experienced it when i studied a lagoon in west africa in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad sunburrow , and i really didn &apos;t get from there .
it was my first sunburn .
as you can see , the lagoon was surrounded by palms and some mangroves .
there were 20-squares of about 20 centimeters , schwarzschild walls , a subspecies of bunks .
the fisheries of these bunks were very powerful , and the fishermen lived well on it , and they deserved well in ghana overaverage .
when i got back there 27 years later , the fish was shrinked to half its size .
they grow up to five centimeters .
they had been genetically expressed .
they were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also fortunate to be there .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story talks about what i &apos;ve been involved in is the introduction of schleppie fishery in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- at the early &apos; 60s -- europe funded a lot of developmental projects .
housing meant countries that have already taken 100,000 fish , the industrial fisheries of this rather ugly ship is called mutiara 4a .
i was driving on it , and we were making bumps around the south chinese sea , and especially in javasee .
we had no words for what we started there .
i know now that it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our initial infants were weakness , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the rubble pile , were coral reef fish .
basically , the bottom of the sea was on deck , and then it was thrown back .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is going very fast .
within a year , you go through an elevation , and then you start with the commercial fishing traction .
the reason is changed . for -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals get grim .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat them , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a vibrant .
she wasn &apos;t drowning yet .
and then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of bars is accumulated by fishermen every time they drive into areas where they &apos;ve never been fished .
it &apos;s not documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adjust our communications to the new level , and we don &apos;t call ourselves in remembering what was there .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are a few good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green of your country , the water supply .
over time , it &apos;s changing . it &apos;s changing , because for humans , their actions are completely natural .
every generation looks at the pictures that they take on at the beginning of their conscious lives , as standard and will deploy everything from it .
the difference is then seen as loss .
but they don &apos;t think of the previous losses .
there can be a order of changes .
and in the end , they just want to get the poorest remains .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do now .
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are no longer the way they were .
now you might think that the problem of people who certainly were living in the predatory societies , killing animals , and who had only been aware of a few generations of what they had done .
because obviously , an animal that &apos;s been around very often , only rarely before it dies .
so you don &apos;t usually lose any animals that are occurring .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a great loss .
over time , we focus on the big animals , and in the sea , these are the big fish .
they get less , because we catch them .
and over time , there &apos;s little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the trend value .
the question is , why do people accept this ?
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different once .
of course , many people , scientists , will tell you that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it , because the evidence , as they &apos;re proposing in a previous form , is not the way that they would like to demonstrate the evidence .
there are , for example , the anecdote that the report of a captain &apos;s soundso , who observed large fisheries in this area can &apos;t be used , or can &apos;t be used by fishing scientists normally because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in trained societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the tremendous amount of role that a marine protected area can play .
because , through marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically recreating the past .
we &apos;re making the past that people can &apos;t access , because the standards have changed and are very low .
and with that , the people who see a marine protected area and can benefit from looking at it , which enables you to bring down your own histories .
what about the people who can &apos;t do that , because they don &apos;t have access to -- the people in the mid-west , for example ?
here , i think the art and the movie may fill the gap , as well as simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was gray whales -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes and the skins might remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people got so touched -- apart from the pocahontase story , why were you so touched by the picture world ?
because it has some wax that has lost in some way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give is cameron to turn &quot; avatar ii &quot; underwater .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist east germany , you had to , if you had a writing machine , register it at the government .
they also had to register a sheet of unprecedented text from this typewriter .
the reason : the government could track back where a text came from .
they found an article with a mischief thought , and they could feel the creator of that thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west how anyone could do this , and how much that would constraint the freedom of speech .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but if you buy a new color printer in 2011 today from the leading laser prints of laser prints and print a page , then this side is bright yellow spots on every page , in a pattern that clearly scales the page on them and the backs of their printer back . &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
this is what &apos;s happening to us today .
and no one seems to get up on that .
and this was an example of how our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of the online problems that we have today .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks into categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , this is mr. dimitry golubow from kiew in ukraine .
and the online criminals motives are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use online attacks to earn a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online millionaries , multimillionaians who made their money through attacks .
this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzalez .
stephen watts .
björn sundin .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on and so forth .
these people have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve illegal acquired it by using trojans , for example , to clap money from our bank accounts while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or even keyloggers who have collected our credit card information on the board online .
the u.s. intelligence agency fror two months ago , the swiss konto of mr. sam jain was here , and on this account , there were 14.9 million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is unknown on her foot , the uprising is unknown .
and i want to argue that today , it &apos;s more likely that we will be victims of an online crime than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , most crime are going to be online .
the second largest growing group we can observe today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- for example , an opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous have gone up over the last 12 months , and have become one of the main players in the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main group of anxiety : criminals doing it because of money , hacktivists such as anonymous who resisted with it , but the last group are nations , governments who run the attacks .
there are times when it comes to us , like diginotar .
it shows a precedent of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a full-mass certificate from the netherlands -- or that was it .
in the last fall , it had to raise insolz , because diginotar had been hacked .
someone had broken in and hacked the system very thoroughly .
and last week in a meeting with dutch government officials , i asked one of the chief of this group the question of whether he made it possible because of the diginotar-hacks people had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in a series of hacks ?
diginotar is a certification site .
they sell certificate .
what do you do with certificates ?
now , a certificate , if you have a website with https , with ssl-encrypted services , for example , gmail .
now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly distributed in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents spend foreign aid like gmail , because they know that they can &apos;t trust any more than local affairs and how they can &apos;t interfend their local government .
but can you , if you go to an external foreign view ?
certificate agency hacking and colored certificate .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of diginotar .
how about the arab spring and the things that happened , for example , in egypt ?
well , in egypt plunders , in april 2011 , the headquarters of the egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of actors .
in these acts , a folder was called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and in this folder they found a few programs in germany that the egyptian government had sold a couple of programs that they could -- in very large framework -- could catch any communication in the egyptian citizen .
they had sold this program for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to run against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany just a couple of weeks ago , the so-called state janer , which was a trojan who was used by german government leaders to beside their own citizen .
if you &apos;re going to be suspected in a criminal case , you have a pretty good security app your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they taped their internet connection .
they use the tools like the state strojans to occupy their computers with a trojan that allows them to monitor their entire communication , to listen to their online discussions , to collect their passwords .
so if we continue to think about things like this , then the obvious answer of people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not for me , because i &apos;m a braver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and while we like trust today , in 2011 , our governments are every right that we &apos;re spending on all the time .
and we trust , we trust blind to every future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with over the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete blocks .
the first concrete blocks were made in 1868 and designed a simple idea : module out of cement with determined measurements that fit together .
concrete tiles have become very quickly the maintenance unit in the world .
they put us in a position to build things bigger than we were , buildings , bridges , one stone after another .
basically , the emphasis building block has become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it was called automatically combine stein .
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 rocks for each person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego basically did the concrete building block , the building block of the world , and it &apos;s made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , at the same time that bell labs announced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a world of static , riddled building blocks to a world where everything was interactive .
like the betonblock , the transistor allows us to build a much larger , more complex cycle , one stone after another .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally do not accept that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started to develop littong .
let me show you how they work .
littlebits are electronic module that have a specific function .
they &apos;re preferred , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best part about this is that they connect with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them in the wrong way .
the stones are colored .
green is output , blue is electricity , pink is input , and orange is cable .
so all you have to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build widely larger circles .
they put a blue on a green one , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and you &apos;ve created a little dimmer .
take the switch out to put a pulldul that &apos;s in here , and you made a little blinker .
add this buzzer to an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple games , littlebine is actually quite powerful .
instead of having to code , wire or delete , littong allows them to code with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to speed the blind or slow it down , just turn it on the button , and it makes the pulse faster or slower .
the idea behind littingness is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to put every single interaction in the world into a commodified rock .
lights , notes , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve distributed littong to kids , and you can see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how you start to understand the electronics that surrounds you and you don &apos;t learn in school .
for example , how a night light works , or why the doors of the elevator react to touch , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we also brought littlebcts to design schools .
so , for example , we didn &apos;t have any experience in electronic things that started to play with littong as materials .
here we see , with filce , paper and water bottles , like geordie ...
a couple of weeks ago , we put littlebits too risd , and we gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just karton , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a movable contax channel .
but wait , this is my favorite project .
it &apos;s a lobster made of play-doh , which is scared in the darkness .
for those non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics just became one more material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
so littong is open source .
you can go to the website , you can download all the design requirements and make it yourself .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the creator , the encouragement , because this world that we live in , that interactive world , we belong to us .
so , go ahead and start inventing them .
thank you .
